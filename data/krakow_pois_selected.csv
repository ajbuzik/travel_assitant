The buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café ""Stylowa"" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant ""Arkadia,"" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  
In 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide ""Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta"" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, ""Stylowa"" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  
From 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to ""Stylowa,"" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of ""Stylowa"" and was going to ""Arkadia,"" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in ""Stylowa"" would jokingly order ""pork chop for Lenin"" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called ""The Bar Under the Stub."" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at ""Stylowa"" and was punished with a one-year ban.  
After the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, ""Stylowa,"" due to its preserved ""People's Poland color,"" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,restaurant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,polish,,,,,Kraków,,,,pedestrian_zone,,,no,Stylowa,95

The initiator of the monument’s creation was probably Stefan Rejtan, one of the last representatives of the family. It was made between 1856 and 1859 at the Lilpop, Rau, and Loewenstein factory in Warsaw. A faithful copy of the monument can be found on the grave of Stanisław Lilpop at the Warsaw Powązki Cemetery, made after 1866. The monument was given to Krakow as a gift from the Rejtan family in the late 1880s. The official unveiling of the monument in Krakow took place in June 1890; it did not attract much interest from the residents, and the monument itself was repeatedly criticized for its ""cemetery character."" In fact, the neo-Gothic form of the chapel was a very popular motif in gravestone architecture at that time, and the monument was originally intended to be placed on Rejtan's grave in Lachowicze. The neo-Gothic chapel, made of cast iron, contained a bust of Tadeusz Rejtan signed by the little-known sculptor Teodor Zakrzewski. In February 1946, the monument, damaged by a storm, was dismantled, and the bust of Rejtan was transferred to the collections of the National Museum in Krakow. In the 1990s, the idea of returning the monument to the square, which was once part of the Krakow Planty, emerged. However, the monument was recreated only in 2007. The reconstruction of the monument was undertaken by Czesław Dźwigaj. This was based on meticulously gathered documentation, especially archival photographs, as well as the same monument standing on the Lilpop family tomb at the Warsaw Powązki. The bust itself was made based on the preserved original in the National Museum in Krakow, introducing, as is standard practice in such cases, a so-called ""material error,"" meaning an element that differentiates the replica from the original. In the case of the Krakow monument, Prof. Dźwigaj decided that one of Rejtan's hair strands would be directed differently. The monument stands on a granite base forming two steps, each 30 cm high, measuring 11 meters in height and weighing 6 tons. The cost of recreating the monument was 900,000 zlotys. The installation of the monument took place on May 24, 2007, while the ceremonial unveiling of the monument was conducted on June 9, 2007, during the ongoing celebrations of the 750th anniversary of the founding of the city of Krakow.",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tadeusz Rejtan,2384

On the first floor is a room dedicated to Ignacy Łukasiewicz, a pharmacist, pioneer in the field of crude oil, and the inventor of the modern kerosene lamp. The room on the second floor of the exhibition is devoted to Tadeusz Pankiewicz, a Roman Catholic who ran the ""Under the Eagle"" pharmacy in the Kraków Ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Among the various exhibits of pharmaceutical technology are weights of less than one gram as patented by Marian Zahradnik, the shape of which indicates their importance. Such weights were adopted in the countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later across Europe, and are still used with minor modifications. Another interesting invention is an electrical device to sterilize prescriptions. It was to protect the pharmacist from infection by germs transferred on the prescription.

In 2005, after the privatization of HTS, due to plans to demolish the Zgniatacz, it was moved to Central Square where it was ceremoniously unveiled again. The monument was unveiled by Kazimierz Fugiel, one of the leaders of the first strikes at the steelworks, Władysław Kielian, the chairman of the Steelworkers' Workers' Commission, and Zdzisław Siudak, an employee of the Zgniatacz. The monument was consecrated by the Metropolitan Archbishop of Gdańsk, Tadeusz Gocłowski, and the Metropolitan Archbishop of Kraków, Stanisław Dziwisz.

The monument takes the form of a steel letter V, mounted on a pedestal (originally made of bricks). This letter is the so-called ""bunny,"" two fingers of the hand arranged in the shape of the letter V symbolizing victory, a gesture by Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War II. Eleven plaques with important dates in the history of Nowa Huta are placed on it, starting from 1960 and the defense of the cross, the date of the election of Karol Wojtyła, and the dates of his visits to Nowa Huta, the date of the establishment of Solidarity, and others. At the base, there is a crowned eagle. Below, on the pedestal, there are four plaques commemorating: the defense of the Nowa Huta cross, the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope, the December events in Gdańsk in 1970, and the establishment of Solidarity in 1980, as well as a fourth commemorating the establishment of NSZZ Solidarity in Nowa Huta. Below the plaques, there is the inscription SOLIDARNOŚĆ written in ""solidaryca."" At the base of the monument, there is a plaque informing that it is dedicated to ""the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity.""

The text on the plaque reads:
The monument is dedicated to the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity. Its shape refers to the letter V - a symbol of victory. The dates placed on the monument commemorate pivotal events for Nowa Huta's Solidarity, such as: the fight for the cross/1960/ the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope /1978/ and his first pilgrimages to the homeland, including those during which he visited Nowa Huta /1978/1983/ the workers' strikes /1980/1981/1988/ and the reactivation of Solidarity /1989/.

The monument was built by the Workers' Commission of Steelworkers of the NSZZ Solidarity of the Sendzimir Steelworks at the initiative of Solidarity members from the Rolling Mill Zgniatacz with funds donated by sponsors and collected in a public fundraiser. It was unveiled on November 10, 1999, on the eve of the anniversary of regaining independence. Originally, it stood on the grounds of the Nowa Huta Combined Plant, where in 1980 and 1988, workers' strikes broke out as part of a nationwide protest against the communist authorities and the ideology foreign to the Poles.

The place took its name from the surname of Unterscharführer Albert Hujar (also Huyar) who committed and directed the executions. It is also a mockery of Hujar's surname, which is pronounced similarly to a vulgar Polish language expression for ""penis"" (its English equivalent is ""prick""), hence the name is Polish for ""Prick Hill"", because it could be seen from almost any part of the camp. Before World War II, an old Austrian fortification of the 19th century, dismantled in the 1930s, had been located on a hill. After destroying the fort, a large hexagonal pit remained here, with a circumference of up to 50 meters and a depth of up to 5 meters. 
Starting from August-September 1943, ”Chujowa Gorka” had become the main place of mass executions of prisoners in Plaszow and was used until mid-February 1944, when it was filled with bodies. The prisoners were usually marched to a ditch surrounding Hujowa Gorka and told to lie down. An SS man, a Genickschußspezialist (specialist in shooting in the neck), would then administer a Nackenschuß, a shot in the nape of the neck. A dental technician, usually a Jew, would then pull the gold teeth out of each victim’s mouth. The dead bodies were then covered with a layer of dirt, though once Płaszow became a concentration camp the bodies were burned. The victims’ clothes were sent to the camp’s storehouses and most of the valuables were taken by the executioners. In 1944 the Germans leveled the site and even built some barracks above the mass grave. Immediately after the war, a large wooden cross with barbed wire was erected at the site to commemorate the Christian Poles who died in Płaszów.
Albert Hujar was the German officer who offered the place for the mass execution of Jews who arrived from the town of Bochnia (east of Krakow) in the summer of 1943. Albert Hujar, who served in the Schutzstaffel (SS) Concentration Camp service, is portrayed in the 1993 drama Schindler's List by Norbert Weisser.

In 1977, the President of Kraków, Jerzy Pękala, made another attempt to erect a monument to Wyspiański, with approval from the Ministry of Culture, and the initial funding for this purpose came from leftover funds from the construction of the Grunwald Monument.

The first competition in February 1978 received 77 entries, and then another competition was announced, but ultimately, the project that was sent for realization was the one that did not participate in the competition, authored by Marian Konieczny, who was also a member of the monument’s construction committee and the competition jury.

Filarki are 20–30 m tall and have been undercut by the Vistula. They form the right boundary of its break known as the Tyniecka Gate. The left boundary is formed by the Piekarskie Rocks, and the width of the Vistula terrace in this area does not exceed 400 m.  
Filarki are made of unweathered limestone from the upper Jurassic period without silica. They feature convex rock formations known as pillars and concave fissures which have widened due to karst phenomena, creating separate rock blocks. As a result of karst processes and erosion, the rocks have an uneven surface, rounded shapes, and numerous niches and recesses. They collect snail shells and remnants of small invertebrates.  
At the foot of Filarki, there are large rock blocks. Some lie directly at the base of the rocks, while others are a bit farther away, partially submerged in water. They were formed as a result of a landslide caused by an earthquake in 1786. There were so many fallen rocks that they had to be removed from the riverbed to maintain navigability.

It was established in 1900 at the initiative of Professor Walery Jaworski by a resolution of the Medical Faculty of UJ on April 27. The collections were largely sourced from donations from doctors and professors affiliated with UJ, such as Edward Korczyński, Adam Wrzosek (library), Józef Bogusz (library, collection of tools and instruments), as well as their families, including Ludwik Bierkowski, Tytus Chałubiński, and Adam Bochenek. Jaworski himself also donated his private collections to the museum. After the first year of operation, the museum had 1,222 items (1,769 exhibits), and by 1905 – 4,617.

In 1920, the Department of the History and Philosophy of Medicine was established, directed by Professor Władysław Szumowski, who focused on the systematization and display of the already significant collections. Converted into a Chair, it did not, however, have a permanent location, and the premises obtained in 1937 for the Chair and Museum on M. Kopernika Street 7 were unsuitable for setting up an exhibition. The secured collections there survived the occupation in an undamaged state. Between 1951 and 1956, the Chair was transformed into the Department of Health Organization, which saved the collections during a time when all departments of the history of medicine were being dissolved. The re-establishment of the Chair did not solve the space problem – it was not until 1990 that premises in the House of the Medical Society at 4 Radziwiłłowska Street were allocated for the Museum. The new headquarters were officially opened on June 16, 1992, by the then rector of CM UJ, Professor Andrzej Szczeklik. 

The museum's collections include, among other things, incunabula, documents, manuscripts, commemorative medals, medical instruments, and portraits. An important part of the collection is a large set of surgical instruments and a collection of plaster casts from Professor Bierkowski's anatomic-pathological office, as well as a collection of the history of diseases from the clinic of Professor Maciej Józef Brodowicz.

The museum is named after general Emil August Fieldorf ""Nil"". It is the only such institution in Poland promoting knowledge about the Polish Underground State and its armed forces during World War II. The idea behind the Home Army Museum is to provide a holistic picture of the Polish underground, its spiritual origins and the shape of patriotic heritage to the present day.
The museum was established in 2000 as a local self-government unit but the formal establishment was preceded by a ten-year effort of collecting the historical items of the Home Army Veterans. So far, the museum has collected more than 8,000 exhibits and more than 12,000 archives – mostly gifts of Army Soldiers and their families around the world – historical memorabilia, often with the tenor of relics. The library resources reach about 11,500 volumes.

The permanent exhibition presents the history of Polish Underground State and Home Army in their complexity. The main section of the exhibition begins with the so-called September Campaign (Invasion of Poland, 1939). The division of Poland into two occupied zones, German and Soviet, consists of several sections (pe. Society, Terror, concentration camps, Holocaust and attitude of the Underground State towards persecuted Jews, etc.) and are well documented with photographic displays. Day-by-day life, both civilian and military, and the policy of both occupants is shown in the rich narrative scenography of the exhibition, based on documents and artefacts such as uniforms, munitions, many documents and decorations.
The main part of the exhibition is situated in the basement. Visitors are confronted with hundreds of photos and memorabilia telling stories of selected Home Army members. One of the most precious exhibits is the diary of a famous major ""Hubal"" – Henryk Dobrzański, the first guerilla commander of the World War II in Europe. Among other artefacts there is a replica of a fuselage section of Halifax (British heavy bomber) and a reconstructed inner structure of a V-2 rocket. The reconstruction of a detention cell in which after 1944 Polish Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Department of Security) held members of the Home Army and postwar Freedom and Independence organisation gives the opportunity to experience the communist terror. The museum has an extensive weapon collection, including homemade projectiles.

A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. 
The castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.
For centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe.

The palace was established in 1540 when two neighboring Gothic tenements from the 14th century were combined and rebuilt into a magnate residence. The owners of the new palace at that time were the Firlej family. In the 17th century, when the property was in the possession of the Zbaraskis, a comprehensive reconstruction was carried out to give the building the fashionable stylistic features of the time and to transform it into a representative urban residence of the magnate family. The construction works were supervised by the Flemish architect Henryk van Peene, who was brought to Poland by Jerzy Zbaraski. A baroque, two-story, arcaded courtyard with cloisters and an entrance hall from the side of the Main Market Square was created then. 

Another reconstruction of the residence took place in the years 1778–1783 and was carried out at the request of the then owner, Count Eliasz Wodzicki. Architect Ferdynand Nax gave the palace features of the early classicist style. In the following decades, its owners changed frequently. Among those who lived there were the Potulicki family of the Grzymała coat of arms, the Rostworowski family of the Nałęcz coat of arms, the Wiśniowiecki family of the Korybut coat of arms, the Jabłonowski family of the Prus III coat of arms, and the Radziwiłł family of the Trąby coat of arms. By the end of the 19th century, the building became the property of the Potocki family of the Pilawa coat of arms. At their request, from 1896 to 1898, the residence was restored, transforming the interiors of the ground floor rooms and partially rebuilding the internal courtyard. The architect Karol Zaremba was the author of these changes. 

Further works were carried out in the palace in the years 1910–1912. The designers were architects Ludwik Wojtyczko and Kazimierz Wyczyński. New staircases were installed, and the interiors of the second residential floor were reconstructed. The first floor retained its representative character, emphasized by decorative elements of the salons. After World War II, the palace was renovated and reconstructed. To this day, Corinthian pilasters in the facades, a stone portal, and rich sculptural decoration crowning the top of the building (including coat-of-arms cartouches) have survived.

Jerzego) was a place of worship at Wawel Castle in Kraków, Poland. It was both a royal chapel and the chapel of the commoners. The chapel was governed by the dean and canons of Wawel.
The chapel was located in the outer courtyard of the castle hill. There are not many historical sources. One of the earliest sources mentions it as a chapel of the fortification. The chapel's first mention was around 1243 and the brick structure dates to the reign of King Casimir III the Great. It consisted of one nave with a rectangular sanctuary from the east and vestry to the south. At the nave was a large crypt. 
It was demolished during the Austrian rule in 1804, when the occupying garrison created a large space to hold their drills. The remains of the chapel were excavated after World War II. There are intentions to reconstruct the chapel.",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kościół św.

The plan of the bastion with a central ravelin and a classical ditch with caponiers. 
Around 1888, the object underwent modernization with the construction of traverses on the rampart. After 1907, artillery barracks were added. During World War II, the fort's buildings served as warehouses. The fort was partially demolished and leveled, and then filled with earth in 1950.

Michała) was a place of worship at Wawel Castle in Kraków, Poland. It was both a royal chapel and the chapel of the commoners. The chapel was governed by the dean and canons of Wawel.
The chapel was located in the outer courtyard of the castle hill. The first mention of the chapel dates from 1148. A hundred years later, the chronicler Jan Długosz mentions on the hill a brick chapel on the site of an earlier wooden one during the reign of King Casimir III the Great. The chapel consisted of a nave with a pentagonal chancel to the east and vestry to the north. In the 17th century it was restored due to the efforts of Bishop Jakub Zadzik.
It was demolished during the Austrian rule in 1803–1804, when the occupying garrison created a large space to hold their drills. The remains of the chapel were excavated after World War II. There are intentions to reconstruct the chapel.",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kościół św.

Its aim is to educate through play and to engage in independent or team scientific experiments, research projects, and social initiatives. 

Formally, the institution was established in December 2017. By mid-2022, a headquarters is to be built in the Krakow district of Czyżyny, according to a design prepared by the Wrocław office of Heinle, Wischer und Partner Architekci. The project was selected through an architectural competition, with the results announced on February 17, 2018. The estimated value of the project is approximately 120 million PLN. 

The building will include, among other things, a permanent exhibition, the main theme of which will be humanity. Until the construction investment is realized, the Center intends to carry out its mission, among others, through the activities of the Mobile Exhibition ""Naukowiej."" The exhibition has been operating since February 2019 and is housed in a retractable trailer. It features several exhibits dedicated to the theme of air. The exhibition aims to visit all municipalities in the Małopolskie Voivodeship. 

Despite the lack of finality of the decision regarding the entry in the register of cultural landscape monuments and the absence of consideration of appeals against the issued building permit, construction work began at the end of March 2021. In the second week of May of the same year, the final decision on the entry into the register was signed, while all appeals were dismissed. 

On April 5, 2024, the general contractor handed over the building of the Science Center. At the same time, the dates for the opening ceremony were announced for June 21 and 22, 2024.",,,no information,,,no information,museum,,,MCN Cogiteon,no information,,,,,,,,Izydora Stella-Sawickiego,https://x.com/cogiteon,,https://www.facebook.com/cogiteon,,biuro@cogiteon.pl,,,,,,,Kraków,https://www.instagram.com/cogiteon.pl,,,,science,,,Małopolskie Centrum Nauki Cogiteon;Małopolska Science Center Cogiteon;MCN Cogiteon;Cogiteon,3420

The history of the park began in 1162, when a wealthy nobleman Jaksa z Miechowa – founder of the Polish branch of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre – donated the land between Zwierzyniec and Łobzów to Norbertine Nuns. His intention was to receive a blessing prior to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. For the next two centuries the meadow belonged to nuns, who in 1366 exchanged it with the city's authorities for a manor at Florianska Street. The meadow was used by peasants from neighboring villages to graze their cattle.
Until the 19th century Błonia Park was largely neglected, and often flooded by the Rudawa river in the spring turning it into wetland with small islands, probably contributing to the spread of epidemics. After draining the swamps, Błonia became perfectly suitable to host large gatherings. In 1809, when the city was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw, Błonia was a place of salute of the troops of Napoleon, organized by Prince Jozef Poniatowski and General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski.  
Today Błonia is a recreation area, frequently hosting large events like concerts and exhibitions. The place is best known for great Masses celebrated by Pope John Paul II in 1979, 1983, 1987, 1997 and 2002. Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated the Mass there during his journey to Poland in May 2006. The opening Mass of the 2016 World Youth Day was held at Błonia Park in July 2016, however the main events, including the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis, were held outside the city.
Błonia Park is also used to host popular culture events, such as concerts organized by a local radio station or the Iuvenalia student festival. Pop star Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour concert on June 28, 2008 performed to nearly 55,000 people  The vast meadow was also used for politicized promotion of the Małopolska region farming industry by PSL in 2011 with a herd of 150 sheep trucked in from hundreds of kilometres away for one month, and the city permit worth 3,200 złoty. The last cattle grazed at Błonia in the 1970s.",,,no information,,,no information,attraction,,,Błonia krakowskie,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Błonia;Błonia krakowskie;Lange Wiese;Краковский луг,3430

It is a Brick Gothic church. Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz). Some of its monumental polychrome murals were designed by Poland's leading history painter, Jan Matejko (1838–1893). In 1978, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.
On every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, a trumpet signal—called the Hejnał mariacki—is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary's two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th-century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by Polish Radio Jedynka.
Saint Mary's Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint Michael's and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral style.
The church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1928 book The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly.",,,no information,,,no information,attraction,,,Kościół pw.

The great importance of effective fire defense is evidenced by the fact that the construction of the fire station took precedence in the hierarchy of importance over such investments as: the Słowacki Theatre, Collegium Novum, or the city’s waterworks. The complex of buildings included: barracks for officers and firefighters, a fire department, stables for horse-drawn fire engines and firefighting vehicles, workshops, a hose drying room, a gym, and an alarm telegraph. The unit was equipped with the latest rescue and firefighting equipment at the time: several 4-wheeled, 2-stream fire engines, several manual extension ladders, and a mechanical ladder. The entire complex has survived to this day almost unchanged, with the main building made of red brick adjoining the street and three symmetrically arranged gates. Only one of the outer gates has been remodeled to allow access for modern fire engines, as the building is still used by the fire brigade.

The façade of the palace is adorned with a colonnade, topped with a statue of Apollo in a sunny halo. The building's roof is made of metal, partially glazed.

The church houses a miraculous image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, crowned with papal crowns in 1929. Here, the future primate of Poland, August Hlond, received his priestly ordination. Additionally, the garden contains Baroque chapels, including a wooden chapel with a Calvary. On the wall of the convent, there is a sundial with an inscription reading ""Life is a short dream.""

It is named after Jalu Kurk, a Polish poet and prose writer, representative of the so-called Krakow Avant-Garde. 

The park initially served as the garden of the Montelupich Palace, built in this place in the 15th century. It was common property until the property of the palace was taken over by the Tarnowski family. Stanisław Tarnowski, after remodeling the palace, transferred the palace garden to the city for public use by all residents. In 1948, the Congregation of the Salvatorians purchased the palace along with the park from the Tarnowskis. 

After World War II, the grounds of the palace and park were taken over by the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. The palace housed the headquarters of Radio Kraków, and the park was fully opened to the city's residents. 

After 1989, when a property commission for the Catholic Church was established, the congregation applied to the commission for the return of the palace and the adjacent park. The park was returned to the congregation, while the request for the return of the palace was withdrawn by the congregation when the Tarnowski family began efforts to declare the expropriation invalid. 

After the congregation regained the park, despite numerous protests from local residents, students from the nearby Krakow University of Technology, and councilors from District I, the park was closed. The congregation officially stated that the reason for the park's closure was the lack of funds for repairing the lighting and infrastructure of the park. 

In 2008, the owners of the park applied for development conditions for part of the parkland, wishing to build the European Center for Salvatorian Formation on that site. They also informed that if they received permission for development, the remaining part of the park would be made available to the city's residents. However, the proposal for development was rejected by Jan Janczykowski, the provincial conservator of monuments. 

Currently, an office building is being constructed on a part of the plot that is not protected, which previously served as the entrance to the park. 

Since 2017, the authorities of the city of Krakow have been in discussions with the Salvatorians regarding land exchange or the purchase of the park. Ultimately, in 2022, the Krakow municipality purchased the park area for the amount of 11 million PLN. The park was made available to residents on January 1, 2023. The park is open daily from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.",,,no information,,,park,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Park imienia Jalu Kurka,3477

Together with the Sandomierska tower, it forms a unique group of so-called fire towers.

It was probably erected between 1447 and 1460 during the reign of Casimir Jagiellonian to strengthen the castle's defenses after the spread of new types of artillery. The lower floors are made of stone, while the upper ones are made of brick. Vertical communication was provided by stairs located within the thickness of the wall. Shortly after its construction, a decision was made to raise the tower by covering it with a high steep roof. Around 1517, a new arrow slit was cut into the wall of the ground floor. In 1534, the tower was connected to the southern wing of the royal palace, and the lower floors were remodeled, among other purposes, to accommodate a chamber for the ""young king,"" i.e., Sigismund Augustus. According to Bielski's Chronicle, in 1595, the highest floor above the corbels was lowered ""due to the great weight it had."" At that time, a finish with panel divides and round windows was created. Its oldest name, Lubranka, comes from the name of the castle's attorney general, Grzegorz from Lubraniec. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was also called Olbramka, Wolbromka, and Skarbowa. Ultimately, the name Senatorska Tower was adopted. In October 1536, a fire destroyed the tower, which was renovated between 1540 and 1543. In 1584, near the tower, Samuel Zborowski was executed.

The tower has been repeatedly damaged by fires, including in 1656 during the Swedish occupation, and renovated. Around 1858, it was remodeled (like other Wawel towers) by the Austrians, with the removal of the sloping roof and the introduction of a pseudo-Gothic crenellation. Further unfavorable modifications occurred during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1943, when the latrine bay was removed, a window was cut into the ground floor, the vault in the basement was removed, and a fireplace was placed where the historical entrance used to be. Around 1965, the damaged pseudo-Gothic crenellation from the partitioning times was replaced. The repeatedly proposed restoration of the historical shape of the tower with the roof covering was realized only in 2002-2003 according to the design of architect Piotr Stępień in cooperation with Dr. engineer Stanisław Karczmarczyk.

Stanisława i św. Wacława) is a Catholic cathedral situated on Wawel Hill in Kraków, Poland. Nearly 1000 years old, it is part of the Wawel Castle Complex and is a national sanctuary which served as the coronation site of Polish monarchs.
The current Gothic cathedral is the third edifice on this site; the first was constructed and destroyed in the 11th century and the second one, constructed in the 12th century, was destroyed by a fire in 1305. The construction of the existing church began in the 14th century on the orders of Bishop Nanker. Over time, the building was expanded by successive rulers resulting in its versatile and eclectic architectural composition. There are examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Neogothic elements in the cathedral's façade and interior. The exterior is adorned by side chapels and representative mausoleums, most notable being the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel.
It is the official seat of the Archbishop of Kraków and of the Archdiocese of Kraków. A symbol of Polish statehood and faith, the cathedral hosts important religious events and annual celebrations. Karol Wojtyła, who in 1978 became Pope John Paul II, the day after his ordination to the priesthood offered his first Mass as a priest at the Wawel Crypt on 2 November 1946, and was ordained Kraków's auxiliary bishop in the cathedral on 28 September 1958.",,,no information,,,no information,attraction,,,Bazylika archikatedralna pw.

To this day, fragments of Gothic stonework from around 1430 and slightly later (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) have been preserved. In the late 18th century, wooden ceilings were made, and rich polychromy of the walls and ceiling rosettes also date from this period. In the 16th century, the house belonged to the architect and builder working at the court of Polish King Sigismund the Old, and Kazimierz councilor Bartolomeo Bereccy, and later to his daughter Anna. The building is currently topped with a rarely encountered classicist broken roof (the so-called Krakow roof). The name of the building refers to the legend of Esterka, the Jewish bride of King Casimir the Great. Her name is also associated with several other places in Kraków: Ester Street, Esterka Mound, and a small tenement that stood until 1932 at the junction of Szczepański Square and Reformacka Street. Since a thorough renovation took place from 1978 to 1985, Dom Esterki has housed a branch of the nearby Ethnographic Museum. Previously, in the 1950s and 60s, a coffee bar ""Esterka"" operated here.",,,no information,,,no information,museum,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Muzeum Etnograficzne (Dom Esterki);Néprajzi Múzeum (Esterka-ház),3540

It is located in the western part of Krakow, in the northern part of the Sowińca Range within the Wolski Forest, on the side of Wola Justowska. These areas are part of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park.

The purpose of the reserve's protection is to preserve the only fragment of natural forest near Krakow for scientific, educational, and socio-cultural reasons, featuring picturesque exposed limestone rocks.

The area protected encompasses the lower part of a long and deep gorge known as the Wolski Doł. The limestone rocks date back to the late Jurassic period and create a gateway in Wolski Doł. This gorge is loessy in the upper part and rocky in the lower part. It has steep walls rising from several to several dozen meters.

A path known as Grabowski's walkway runs along its bottom – named in honor of Ambroży Grabowski, the author of the first guidebook to Krakow and its surroundings. He also popularized the name Panieńskie Skały in 1822. In the past, they were also called Wolski Rocks or Przygrzyb.

The name of the rocks comes from the nuns of a nearby Norbertine monastery in Salwator, who took refuge in this area during the Tatar invasion in 1241. According to a popular legend, the nuns were miraculously saved from disgrace and death at the last moment, as the rocks closed behind them, protecting them from the assailants. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands today at the site of the alleged miracle. According to another version, when the Tartars were pursuing the nuns, the rocks collapsed beneath them, shielding them from disgrace. Supposedly there is a chamber and a table beneath the rocks where they gather to pray, which could still be seen through a crack in the rock until recently.

The slopes are covered with a natural beech forest (the oldest in the Wolski Forest area, with most trees around 140-160 years old) mixed with oak, pine, hornbeam, and sycamore. The stand was protected since 1917 when the forest was purchased by the Savings Bank of the City of Krakow. As a result, very old specimens of flowering common ivy have survived in the Wolski Forest (ivy flowers only at several decades of age). In the forest undergrowth in spring, before the trees develop their leaves, bloom: rue-leaved globe flower, wood anemone, persistent water crowfoot, twisted-leaved buttercup, full-flowered mercurialis, Rivina violet, creeping bugle, and common hepatica. There is also common butterwort, lily of the valley, and even the rare laurel-willow.

Near the reserve stands a wooden church dedicated to the Mother of God Queen of Poland, where the last scene of the film ""Potop"" directed by Jerzy Hoffman was shot.

A new species of predatory snail was discovered in the reserve. It has been named Falniowskia neglectissima. It is likely an endemic species and due to its rarity is listed in the Polish Red Book of Animals.

In the Panieńskie Skały, cavers have described several rock vacuums: Chimney in Panieńskie Skały, Twisted Shelter in Panieńskie Skały, Upper Shelter in the Panieńskie Skały, Shelter behind the Pillar in Panieńskie Skały, Crack in Panieńskie Skały, Tunnel in Panieńskie Skały, Niche in Panieńskie Skały.",,,no information,,,nature_reserve,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rezerwat Panieńskie Skały,3551

It is located in Duża Kowodrza in the Tyniec Hills, within the area of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park and the Natura 2000 Dębnicko-Tyniecki meadow area. It is situated in the northernmost part of the Tyniec Hills, at the exit from the A4 motorway to Tyniec.  
It is a partial faunal reserve covering an area of 36.77 ha. It was established in 1957 in the then village of Tyniec. It includes a fragment of land covered with forest and communities of thermophilic shrubs, while sandy and xerothermic grasslands also occur on the edges and glades. It protects a pine-fir-beech forest, xerothermic vegetation, and in particular about 500 species of rare butterflies and hymenopterans, including the dryad stonewort.  
The grasslands occurring in the reserve are of semi-natural character and require active conservation measures to prevent overgrowth by trees and shrubs. Among the protected plants found here are: stemless carline thistle, red geranium, common wild thyme, meadow pasque flower, Pannonian thyme, common houseleek, lily of the valley, and common buttercup.  
In April 2010, part of the reserve, encompassing a grassland complex and the habitat of the dryad stonewort, burned down.  
In the southern part of the reserve, there are two collective graves in which about 500 Jews from the Kraków area are buried – victims of the German genocide murdered in the summer of 1942.  

On the northwest side of the Skołczanka reserve, there is a similar protected area, but with the status of an ecological use – Uroczysko Kowadza. Meanwhile, to the northeast of the reserve, an ecological use called Dąbrowa has been established.  
There is a marked hiking trail running through the reserve:  

a green loop from the Benedictine Abbey through Wielkanoc, Kowadza, Duża Kowodrza, Skołczanka reserve, Ostra Góra, Guminek, Stępnicą, Grodzisko, along the Vistula River, and back to the Benedictine Abbey.

lit. ) of the Old Town of Kraków, Lesser Poland, is the principal urban space located at the center of the city. It dates back to the 13th century, and at 3.79 ha (9.4 acres) is sometimes called the largest medieval town square in Europe, but Charles Square in Prague is two times larger.
The Main Square is a square space surrounded by historic townhouses (kamienice) and churches. The center of the square is dominated by the Cloth Hall (Sukiennice), rebuilt in 1555 in the Renaissance style, topped by a attic or Polish parapet decorated with carved masks. On one side of the cloth hall is the Town Hall Tower (Wieża ratuszowa), on the other the 11th century Church of St. Adalbert and 1898 Adam Mickiewicz Monument. Rising above the square are the Gothic towers of St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). Kraków Main Square does not have a town hall, because it has not survived to the present day.",,,no information,,,no information,attraction,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rynek Główny;Main Square;Plaza del Mercado;Площа Ринок;Hauptmarkt;Főpiac tér (Rynek Główny);Галоўны рынак;Rynek;中央集市廣場;리네크 글루프니;ana meydan,3572

It was built between 1885 and 1886, most likely designed by Daniel Salis-Soglio, and based on its model, three forts were constructed in the Przemyśl Fortress. Fort 52 ""Borek"" belonged to the VIII defensive sector of the Kraków Fortress, covering the areas between the valleys of the Wilga and the upper Vistula. It is a double-ring artillery fort. The higher rampart was intended for artillery, while the lower one was for infantry and light guns. The caponiers were equipped with machine guns and later with automatic rifles. The fort features the first three-level underground intersection in Kraków for the movement of soldiers and transportation of armaments.  
The fort's task was to guard the exits of main roads and to defend the Vienna route (now known as Zakopianka) and approaches to the fortress ring from the direction of Libertów. The fort did not participate in the battles of World War I.  
During World War II, Russian and French prisoners were held in the fort. On December 26, 1944, an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was forced to land with its landing gear retracted in front of the fort. It had been damaged during a raid on the refinery in Blechhammer (now: Blachownia, part of Kędzierzyn-Koźle), and its crew attempted to reach areas controlled by the Red Army. Until the 1990s, there was a vehicle and equipment base of a construction cooperative located here. For several years, it remained unused and was in poor technical condition. From 2013 to 2022, the fort underwent revitalization, and since July 30, 2022, it has been managed by the Podgórze Cultural Center and is the seat of the Polish Song Library. In the place where the American bomber landed in 1944, trees grew after the war. In June 2022, the area was developed and made available to residents as a park.

In the 19th century, it was first linked to the site of former pagan cults, just like the earlier parish church of the Holy Savior. From then on, it was referred to as Gontyny.

Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.
This branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). 
In 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.
The permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children.

By decision of the Krakow City Council, it was named after Father Laetus Bernatek, a monk who in the late 19th and early 20th centuries facilitated the construction of the Bonifratrów hospital buildings in Krakow.  
The footbridge, designed by the Authorial Design and Plastic Studio of Professor Andrzej Getter, takes the form of a steel arch suspended between the existing abutments of the Podgórski Bridge, to which two platforms are attached (one for pedestrians and the other for cyclists). The steel arch is 145 meters long, while the platforms are about 130 meters. The entire structure weighs over 700 tons, and its construction cost more than 38 million PLN, of which 15 million PLN came from EU funds.  
The construction of the footbridge contributed to the cultural, social, and tourist revival of the streets leading to it on both sides of the river, as well as the adjacent part of the Vistula boulevards. The importance of the old route between Wolnica Square and Podgórski Market, leading through Mostowa and Kazimierza Brodzińskiego Streets, has been restored.  
Balanced sculptures from the ""Between Heaven and Earth"" series by prominent sculptor Jerzy Kędziora are located on the footbridge.",,,no information,,,no information,attraction,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kładka Ojca Bernatka;Kładka Bernatka,3625

Since 1889, there was a convent of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy in the village of Łagiewniki near Kraków. During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian army organized a military epidemiological hospital in the outbuildings of the convent, which operated from August 1914 to December 1918. About 200 meters southeast of the convent, a cemetery was established to bury soldiers who died in the hospital.  
The necropolis contains the ashes of 266 soldiers (according to some sources 275), of fifteen different nationalities. The cemetery was designed by Hans Mayr, but little of the original design remains, apart from the entrance gate. The grave fields have been leveled, and the small monument is contemporary, as is the cross with a roof, which was made according to Mayr's design.

It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  
It belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  
From 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  
The modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  
In 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  
In the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the ""Kraków"" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  
After World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I.

The college is named after the mathematician and astronomer Jan Śniadecki, who worked at the UJ during the period of the great reform by Kołłątaj. The building has a long history. As early as the 16th century, there was a Renaissance garden in this location, on the grounds of which a palace was built around 1600. Later, it came into the possession of the Czartoryski princes, who created their suburban residence (villa suburbana) here. In 1752, they sold it to the Jesuits, who carried out renovations for their college. After the dissolution of the order, the palace along with the garden passed into the ownership of the Krakow Academy. The palace was remodeled between 1788 and 1792 according to the design of Stanisław Zawadzki. An astronomical observatory was organized here at the inspiration of Śniadecki, and in 1783 a botanical garden was created around the building, where the then chemist and botanist Jan Dominik Jaśkiewicz worked. In the 1960s, the astronomical observatory was moved to Fort 38 ""Skała."" Currently, the college houses the UJ Institute of Botany, the Botanical Garden Museum, as well as the facilities of the Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Research. Next to the building is the entrance to the Botanical Garden. On September 29, 1947, the building was entered into the heritage register.

According to the resolution, the purpose of protecting the site is to preserve the ecosystem that serves as a habitat and refuge for protected and endangered species of plants and animals. The site includes a small anthropogenic water reservoir. It is a clay pit that was created as a result of the extraction of resources by a brick factory operating in Dąbie in the first half of the 20th century. After the clay extraction ceased, the excavation was filled with shallow surface waters. The Białucha River flows nearby, with its mouth to the Vistula River located 400 meters away. Nine species of fish live in the pond, including the protected golden loach. Other species present include the great pond turtle (also protected), the sharp-shelled mussel, the mud crayfish, and aquatic snails. The plant world is represented by the yellow water lily (protected species), found in Kraków in only two locations, floating water knotweed, round-leafed water-milfoil, and stiff hornwort. Along the shores, you can find: common duckweed and triangular duckweed, and narrow-leaved bulrush.

It was established by resolution no. XXXI/405/07 of the Krakow City Council on December 19, 2007. It includes a small water reservoir along with its surroundings, situated in the valley of the Dłubnia River and is part of one of the Dłubnia mill races. The total area is 0.82 hectares.

The area was created to protect the ecosystem, which is a habitat for protected species of animals. Within it, many species of mammals have been observed, 23 species of birds associated with the water reservoir and its surroundings, including the mute swan, several species of amphibians (mainly frogs), and many species of insects, including 14 species of butterflies. Fish, such as the silver crucian carp, are present in the pond.

Around the pond grow several dozen old trees, including the white chestnut (of which 10 are nature monuments) with circumferences at breast height: 168 cm, 231 cm, 230 cm, 275 cm, 295 cm, 206 cm, 294 cm, and 232 cm, which were registered in 2003 (as of 2020). There was another nature monument above the pond – a black elm, which died, and in 2015, the protective status of this tree was lifted. Due to the fact that the subcortical space is inhabited by the brown long-eared bat, it was decided to leave the tree, while simultaneously removing the branches that posed a danger to the safety of passersby.",,,no information,,,nature_reserve,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Staw przy Kaczeńcowej,3843

A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. 
The castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.
For centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 17th most visited art museum in the world.",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zamek Wawel;Wawel;Wawelburg;Kasteel van Wawel,4019

Count Emeryk Hutten-Czapski (born 17 October 1828 in Stankow near Minsk, died 23 July 1896 in Kraków) was a Vice-Governor of St Petersburg and an important collector of books, prints, and numismatics. He built his collection at his family estate in Stankow, today in Belarus. Fearing for the safety of the collection, being close to Russia, he moved the collection to Cracow. In 1894, he purchased a 19th-century palace, on what is today 12 Pilsudski Street, and built an addition to house his collection. He personally catalogued the collection. He died in 1896, before the addition was finished. His wife, Baroness Elzbieta Meyendorff, completed the construction of the addition, and in 1904, as per her husband's request, donated the collection to the city of Cracow. The museum displays the Czapski crest on the outside, along with the inscription on the pediment: ""Monumentis Patriae Naufragio Ereptis"" (Patriotic Monuments Saved from the Destruction of the Storm).
The collection originally contained more than 11,000 coins, medals, orders, prints and books. Upon the death of Bogdan Hutten-Czapski, a nephew of Emeryks, his large collection of books and prints was added to the museum library. The museum continually received generous donations from other coin collectors. Important donations came from Wiktor Wittyg, Zygmunt Zakrzewski, Franciszek Piekosinski, Karol Halama, Piotr Uminski and Konstanty Schmidt-Ciążyński, among others. At the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, the collection was stored in barrels. The museum was reopened in 1917 and once again at the outset of World War II, in 1939, was closed and the collection was again safeguarded.  Since 1939 the museum remained closed to the public. With funding from the European Regional Development Fund of the European Economic Community the project of the European Centre of Numismatics in Cracow could be completed, and the restored museum and gardens were opened once again to the public in 2013. The museum has been renovated to a world class museum with touch screens throughout, explaining the different exhibits in Polish and English.
In April 2016, on the gardens of the museum, a pavilion was erected to commemorate Emeryk's grandson, Józef Czapski. Jozef was an eminent Polish intellectual, writer, painter and critic. The modern pavilion displays Czapski's diaries, paintings, and contains various multimedia presentations. The layout of the Pavilion's permanent exhibition was designed by Krystyna Zachwatowicz and her husband, the film director Andrzej Wajda.",,,no information,,,no information,museum,,,,no information,,,,,,,,Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego,,,,,czapscy@mnk.pl,,,,,,,Kraków,,,,,,,,Muzeum im.

Poland. It encircles the Stare Miasto (Old Town), where the Medieval city walls used to stand until the early 19th century. The historic Old Town is not to be confused with the Administrative District No. 1 Stare Miasto extending further east.
The park has an area of 21 ha (52 acres) and a length of 4 km (2.5 mi). It consists of a chain of thirty smaller gardens designed in varied styles and adorned with numerous monuments and fountains. There are over twenty statues of noble historical figures in the park including monuments to Nicolaus Copernicus, Jan Matejko, Queen Jadwiga and King Wladyslaw II Jagiello. There are also several plaques in the park commemorating, among others, Jan Dlugosz and Stanislaw Wyspianski.  And of famous Polish Mathematician Hugo Steinhaus, Stefan Banach and Otto Nikodym.
The park forms a scenic walkway popular with Cracovians. In summer, sprinkled with ponds and refreshment stalls, it is a cool and shady retreat from the nearby bustling streets.

In 2010, a major renovation of the bridge was carried out, with the stone retaining walls, brick vault, and brick railings rebuilt, as well as stone drains for rainwater installed.

The initial collection was formed in 1796 in Puławy by Princess Izabela Czartoryska. The Museum officially opened in 1878. It is now a division of the National Museum in Kraków.
The Puławy collection was partly destroyed after the November 1830 Uprising and the confiscation of the Czartoryski properties. Most of the Museum holdings, however, were saved and moved to Paris, where they reposed at the Hôtel Lambert. In 1870 Prince Władysław Czartoryski decided to move the collections to Kraków, where they arrived in 1876.
The most renowned painting at the Museum is one of Leonardo da Vinci's best-known works, the Lady with an Ermine. Other highlights include two works by Rembrandt; several antiquities, including sculptures; Renaissance tapestries and decorative arts; and paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger, Jacob Jordaens, Luca Giordano, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Dieric Bouts, Joos van Cleve, Lorenzo Lotto, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Lorenzo Monaco, Andrea Mantegna, Alessandro Magnasco, and the Master of the Female Half-Lengths.

It was probably established during the location of the town of Kleparz in 1366. At that time, it encompassed a much larger area than it does now, approaching the size of Kraków's Main Market Square (it also included today's pl. Jana Matejki and the built-up areas between Rynek Kleparski, pl. Matejki, and the Planty). On the square, at the site of today's primary school, there stood a brick Kleparz town hall (demolished in 1803) and numerous buildings associated with the market functions of the square (the square was divided into several parts, including an eastern section where a horse market operated and a western section that hosted a grain market). The so-called ""Royal Road"" began from the square, running from the St. Florian's Church (then at the corner of Rynek Kleparski), through the Barbican and St. Florian's Gate towards Wawel.

After Kleparz was annexed to Kraków, it was decided to partially build up the square, which lost its status as the main city square – this plan was implemented in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, during which numerous residential houses and public buildings were constructed. In 1880, the western part of the former square officially received the name ""Rynek Kleparski"" and retained the character of a popular market square. Currently, the square features a marketplace managed by the Merchant Company ""Stary Kleparz,"" and its area is occupied by typical market architecture (stalls, etc.).

Rynek Kleparski is surrounded mainly by residential buildings with commercial functions. Notable structures include:

the Neo-Gothic St. Vincent's Church along with the missionaries' monastery (on St. Philip Street),
the ""Phoenix"" building (at the corner with Basztowa Street, built in 1931-1932).
Ludwik Waryński lived at Rynek Kleparski 8. 
Since 2017, a Living Bagel Museum has operated at 4 Ignacy Paderewski Street (in a tenement by Rynek Kleparski).",,,no information,,,no information,no information,,,,marketplace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rynek Kleparski;Клепарський Ринок,9516

The building was designed by the Viennese architect F. Setz. Joseph Sareg adapted the project and it was built between 1887 and 1889 by Charles Knaus and Tadeusz Stryjeński.
Since 1899 it was the headquarters of mail in Kraków. In 1909, it was the location of what is now the Polish automatic telephone exchange with a capacity of 3600 numbers.
Due to growing needs for office surface, between 1930 and 1931 it was rebuilt by Frederick Tadaniera. The interiors and furnishings were updated and in 1933 the intercity telephone exchange was installed.
Another reconstruction took place during the German occupation. The Polish Post Office reopened on January 22, 1945.

The mound is assumed to be the resting place of the legendary princess Wanda. According to one version of the story, she committed suicide by drowning in the Vistula river to avoid unwanted marriage with a German. The mound is located close to the spot on the river bank where her body was found. Archaeological studies, conducted on site in 1913 and in mid-1960, did not provide any conclusive evidence of the mound's age or purpose.
The mound base, some 50 metres (164 ft) in diameter, is at 238 metres (781 ft) AMSL, and its height is 14 metres (46 ft). Unlike the other three mounds in Kraków, this one is not located on a natural hill.
The first written record of the mound comes from the 13th century. Within two kilometres (one mile) of the mound-site in 1225 a monastery was built by the bishop of Kraków, Iwo Odrowąż, called the Mogiła Abbey, which is still active today.

The historical Lasota Hill, on which the Krakus Mound rises, originally belonged to the Awdański family, Polish nobility of Scandinavian origin, and its name commemorates the count Lassota, Lassote castellanus Cracovie.  
On the hill, a Romanesque rotunda connected with a palatium was built in the 10th or 11th century. On its foundations, a small church of St. Benedict was constructed in the 12th century. Between 1853 and 1856, near the church, Fort 31 ""Benedykt"" was built as part of the Austrian Fortress of Kraków.  
On Lasota Hill, one of the oldest quarries in Kraków existed – the Quarry under St. Benedict. Its remnant is the vertical rock wall rising above Rękawka and Wielicka streets. It is a climbing object, described by climbers as the Low Wall, Esteci, and Rocks behind the School.  
On the southeastern slope of the hill, there is the Old Podgórski Cemetery established in the 18th century.  
During World War II, the northern slope of the hill marked the border of the Kraków ghetto, where the Germans murdered several thousand people.

The ""Sokół"" Gymnastic Society was established on February 23, 1885, at the initiative of students associated with the so-called Academic Reading Room of Jagiellonian University. Its goal was to spiritually and physically revive society by cultivating national traditions, patriotic education, and engaging in sports activities, mainly of a paramilitary nature. The ""Sokół"" Society was formed within the framework of the ""Reading Room."" It promoted tourism, gymnastics, and various sports: rowing, shooting, fencing, archery, swimming, athletics, and more. In 1889, the city municipality provided the Society with land on what was then Wolska Street, right by the river Rudawa that flowed there at the time. In the same year, a building was constructed, the falconry. It housed the largest gymnasium in Galicia, equipped with the most modern sports facilities. The edifice was designed by Karol Knaus. The official opening of the building took place on November 18, 1889. In 1894, the falconry was expanded. An eastern part designed by Teodor Talowski was added, giving the building neo-Gothic features. In 1921, the Kraków District of the Polish Gymnastic Society ""Sokół"" was based in the building. On July 31, 1947, representatives of the Security Office sealed the ""Sokół"" building, revoking its permit for operation. From 1957, the building was administered by TKKF. ""Sokół"" regained its building in September 1990 and started a major renovation of the building that had been devastated by the previous user, the Cracovia Sports Club. From 2017 to 2020, the first comprehensive renovation and conservation work since the building's inception took place. Almost the entire cost was financed by the National Fund for the Revaluation of Kraków Monuments granted by the Social Committee for the Renewal of Kraków Monuments. On May 15, 1984, the building was entered into the register of monuments.

Rock climbing is practiced on it.  
Sadystówka is located in the area of the Skałki Twardowskiego nature reserve, one of the recreational areas of Kraków. It is well known to Kraków climbers, but it is absent from climbing guides, not marked on maps, and has very little information available online. Sadystówka is a rock wall that is a remnant of the former Kapelanka limestone quarry. Its height does not exceed 5 meters, but it is 80 meters long. It is perfectly vertical, with some parts slightly overhanging. In the middle section, a small chamber was carved out, which is closed by a door.  
Climbing on Sadystówka has been taking place for about 100 years. In 1910, Mieczysław Świerz and Kazimierz Piotrowski conducted climbing exercises for mountaineers at Zakrzówek, and later, climbers from Kraków climbed here. This long-standing practice of climbing has caused all the holds to be very polished. There is only one climbing route on Sadystówka – but it is long, as it runs not upward but across, traversing the entire length of the wall. It has been rated at VI.3 on the Polish scale. One advantage of Sadystówka is that climbing is possible even in winter, at negative temperatures, as long as the sun shines on the wall. In the past, when there were no artificial climbing walls, some climbers trained on it all year round, allowing them to maintain their form in spring. Mathematician Tomek Opozda completed Sadystówka ten times non-stop.  
On Sadystówka, the holds shine like freshly polished bathroom tiles and can be considered a Kraków standard of polishing, yet it remains a climbing object. In its vicinity, there are several other climbing walls with vertical surfaces: Baba Jaga, Ciąża, Freney, Problemówka, Szara Ścianka. The height of some exceeds 30 meters.",,,cliff,,,no information,no information,,,,no information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sadystówka,11536

Józefa Piłsudskiego) is a football stadium located in Kraków, Poland. It is used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Cracovia. Originally, the first Cracovia stadium was built in 1912. It was demolished in mid-2009.  From then until late 2010, an entirely new construction was raised in roughly the same location where the old stadium stood. After reconstruction the stadium holds 15,114 people.
The stadium meets the criteria for UEFA Category 3
The stadium's design and construction has been frequently awarded in many architectural contests. 
In 2010, it was honored with the Janusz Bogdanowskie award, given by the Archi-Szopa Association for the best architectural construction in Kraków City.
The stadium is located south of Błonia Park (in the Zwierzyniec district of Cracovia), near the stadium of Cracovia's archrival Wisła Kraków.
The stadium is named after Polish Chief of State, Marshal Józef Piłsudski
The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match between Ukraine and Kosovo on 9 October 2016 was played in the stadium due to Ukraine's Ukraine's non-recognition of Kosovo's travel documents. Ukraine's 2022–23 UEFA Nations League home fixtures were also played in this stadium due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
