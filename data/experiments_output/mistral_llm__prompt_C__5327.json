Centrum C 3, in Aleja Róż, initially as a café. It is referred to as \"iconic.\"  \nThe buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café \"Stylowa\" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant \"Arkadia,\" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  \nIn 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide \"Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta\" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, \"Stylowa\" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  \nFrom 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to \"Stylowa,\" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of \"Stylowa\" and was going to \"Arkadia,\" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in \"Stylowa\" would jokingly order \"pork chop for Lenin\" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at \"Stylowa\" and was punished with a one-year ban.  \nAfter the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, \"Stylowa,\" due to its preserved \"People's Poland color,\" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : restaurant\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : polish\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : pedestrian_zone\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : no\nname : Stylowa\nid : 95\n\nphone : +48 12 421 68 42\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo-Su 10:00-18:00\nwebsite : https://galiciajewishmuseum.org/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9496775 50.0508571)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Galicia Jewish Museum (Polish: Żydowskie Muzeum Galicja) is located in the historic Jewish district of Kazimierz in Kraków, Poland.

The monument was erected in 1999 in front of the rolling mill \"Zgniatacz\" of the Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks, the department where the strongest organization of the NSZZ Solidarity was formed at the complex, where in 1988 the strike committee was based, and later a Memory Chamber dedicated to metallurgical \"Solidarity\" was located.\n\nIn 2005, after the privatization of HTS, due to plans to demolish the Zgniatacz, it was moved to Central Square where it was ceremoniously unveiled again. The monument was unveiled by Kazimierz Fugiel, one of the leaders of the first strikes at the steelworks, Władysław Kielian, the chairman of the Steelworkers' Workers' Commission, and Zdzisław Siudak, an employee of the Zgniatacz. The monument was consecrated by the Metropolitan Archbishop of Gdańsk, Tadeusz Gocłowski, and the Metropolitan Archbishop of Kraków, Stanisław Dziwisz.\n\nThe monument takes the form of a steel letter V, mounted on a pedestal (originally made of bricks). This letter is the so-called \"bunny,\" two fingers of the hand arranged in the shape of the letter V symbolizing victory, a gesture by Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War II. Eleven plaques with important dates in the history of Nowa Huta are placed on it, starting from 1960 and the defense of the cross, the date of the election of Karol Wojtyła, and the dates of his visits to Nowa Huta, the date of the establishment of Solidarity, and others. At the base, there is a crowned eagle. Below, on the pedestal, there are four plaques commemorating: the defense of the Nowa Huta cross, the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope, the December events in Gdańsk in 1970, and the establishment of Solidarity in 1980, as well as a fourth commemorating the establishment of NSZZ Solidarity in Nowa Huta. Below the plaques, there is the inscription SOLIDARNOŚĆ written in \"solidaryca.\" At the base of the monument, there is a plaque informing that it is dedicated to \"the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity.\"\n\nThe text on the plaque reads:\nThe monument is dedicated to the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity. Its shape refers to the letter V - a symbol of victory. The dates placed on the monument commemorate pivotal events for Nowa Huta's Solidarity, such as: the fight for the cross/1960/ the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope /1978/ and his first pilgrimages to the homeland, including those during which he visited Nowa Huta /1978/1983/ the workers' strikes /1980/1981/1988/ and the reactivation of Solidarity /1989/.\n\nThe monument was built by the Workers' Commission of Steelworkers of the NSZZ Solidarity of the Sendzimir Steelworks at the initiative of Solidarity members from the Rolling Mill Zgniatacz with funds donated by sponsors and collected in a public fundraiser. It was unveiled on November 10, 1999, on the eve of the anniversary of regaining independence. Originally, it stood on the grounds of the Nowa Huta Combined Plant, where in 1980 and 1988, workers' strikes broke out as part of a nationwide protest against the communist authorities and the ideology foreign to the Poles. Glory to the people who, through sacrifice and perseverance, changed the face of Poland and Europe. Be faithful. Go. The poem, of which a fragment is placed on a plaque on the side of the monument, is the message of Mr. Cogito, a character from a series of poems by Zbigniew Herbert.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pomnik Solidarności\nid : 2421\n\nphone : +48 12 3957065\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Tu-Th 09:00-17:00; Fr-Su 09:00-19:00; PH off\nwebsite : https://www.cogiteon.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : MULTIPOLYGON (((19.9898496 50.0852354, 19.9903389 50.0851391, 19.9904527 50.0851167, 19.9904573 50.0851263, 19.990487 50.0851888, 19.9898762 50.0853096, 19.9898587 50.0853131, 19.9899393 50.0853806, 19.9901311 50.0855413, 19.9903675 50.0857393, 19.990383 50.0857363, 19.990389 50.0857351, 19.9911684 50.0855815, 19.9911743 50.0855803, 19.9911902 50.0855772, 19.9912277 50.0851656, 19.9912391 50.0850402, 19.991223 50.0850434, 19.990689 50.0851489, 19.9906594 50.0850866, 19.9906548 50.0850769, 19.9907686 50.0850545, 19.9908231 50.0850437, 19.9911631 50.0849767, 19.9911792 50.0849736, 19.9912005 50.0849694, 19.9912303 50.0849635, 19.9912472 50.0849602, 19.9912491 50.0849235, 19.991256 50.0847964, 19.9912452 50.0847985, 19.9912221 50.0848031, 19.9905694 50.0849319, 19.9904761 50.0849507, 19.990402 50.0849657, 19.989673 50.0851088, 19.9896443 50.0851145, 19.989632 50.0851169, 19.9897839 50.0852483, 19.9897996 50.0852452, 19.9898496 50.0852354)), ((19.9907781 50.0859263, 19.990934 50.0858956, 19.9911429 50.0858543, 19.9911496 50.085853, 19.9911649 50.08585, 19.9911744 50.0857455, 19.9911824 50.0856577, 19.991167 50.0856607, 19.9908515 50.0857231, 19.9906191 50.085769, 19.9904595 50.0858006, 19.9904444 50.0858036, 19.9905288 50.0858746, 19.9906258 50.0859563, 19.9906409 50.0859534, 19.9906469 50.0859522, 19.9907781 50.0859263)), ((19.9911563 50.0859308, 19.9911422 50.0859336, 19.990969 50.0859679, 19.9908122 50.0859989, 19.9907296 50.0860153, 19.9907174 50.0860177, 19.9907028 50.0860206, 19.9910015 50.0862716, 19.9911174 50.086369, 19.9911277 50.0862533, 19.9911465 50.0860414, 19.9911563 50.0859308)))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Małopolskie Centrum Nauki Cogiteon – a science center, a cultural institution of the Małopolskie Voivodeship. Its aim is to educate through play and to engage in independent or team scientific experiments, research projects, and social initiatives. \n\nFormally, the institution was established in December 2017. By mid-2022, a headquarters is to be built in the Krakow district of Czyżyny, according to a design prepared by the Wrocław office of Heinle, Wischer und Partner Architekci. The project was selected through an architectural competition, with the results announced on February 17, 2018. The estimated value of the project is approximately 120 million PLN. \n\nThe building will include, among other things, a permanent exhibition, the main theme of which will be humanity.

ˈɡwuvnɨ] lit. ) of the Old Town of Kraków, Lesser Poland, is the principal urban space located at the center of the city. It dates back to the 13th century, and at 3.79 ha (9.4 acres) is sometimes called the largest medieval town square in Europe, but Charles Square in Prague is two times larger.\nThe Main Square is a square space surrounded by historic townhouses (kamienice) and churches. The center of the square is dominated by the Cloth Hall (Sukiennice), rebuilt in 1555 in the Renaissance style, topped by a attic or Polish parapet decorated with carved masks. On one side of the cloth hall is the Town Hall Tower (Wieża ratuszowa), on the other the 11th century Church of St. Adalbert and 1898 Adam Mickiewicz Monument. Rising above the square are the Gothic towers of St. Mary's Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). Kraków Main Square does not have a town hall, because it has not survived to the present day.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : yes\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Rynek Główny;Main Square;Plaza del Mercado;Площа Ринок;Hauptmarkt;Főpiac tér (Rynek Główny);Галоўны рынак;Rynek;中央集市廣場;리네크 글루프니;ana meydan\nid : 3572\n\n",
