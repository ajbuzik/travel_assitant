Together with the Sandomierska tower, it forms a unique group of so-called fire towers.\n\nIt was probably erected between 1447 and 1460 during the reign of Casimir Jagiellonian to strengthen the castle's defenses after the spread of new types of artillery. The lower floors are made of stone, while the upper ones are made of brick. Vertical communication was provided by stairs located within the thickness of the wall. Shortly after its construction, a decision was made to raise the tower by covering it with a high steep roof. Around 1517, a new arrow slit was cut into the wall of the ground floor. In 1534, the tower was connected to the southern wing of the royal palace, and the lower floors were remodeled, among other purposes, to accommodate a chamber for the \"young king,\" i.e., Sigismund Augustus. According to Bielski's Chronicle, in 1595, the highest floor above the corbels was lowered \"due to the great weight it had.\" At that time, a finish with panel divides and round windows was created. Its oldest name, Lubranka, comes from the name of the castle's attorney general, Grzegorz from Lubraniec. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was also called Olbramka, Wolbromka, and Skarbowa. Ultimately, the name Senatorska Tower was adopted. In October 1536, a fire destroyed the tower, which was renovated between 1540 and 1543. In 1584, near the tower, Samuel Zborowski was executed.\n\nThe tower has been repeatedly damaged by fires, including in 1656 during the Swedish occupation, and renovated. Around 1858, it was remodeled (like other Wawel towers) by the Austrians, with the removal of the sloping roof and the introduction of a pseudo-Gothic crenellation. Further unfavorable modifications occurred during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1943, when the latrine bay was removed, a window was cut into the ground floor, the vault in the basement was removed, and a fireplace was placed where the historical entrance used to be. Around 1965, the damaged pseudo-Gothic crenellation from the partitioning times was replaced. The repeatedly proposed restoration of the historical shape of the tower with the roof covering was realized only in 2002-2003 according to the design of architect Piotr Stępień in cooperation with Dr. engineer Stanisław Karczmarczyk. The roof was covered with monk-nun tiles, and the latrine bay destroyed by the German occupiers was reconstructed. These works were combined with the conservation of the entire wall of the tower.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no
