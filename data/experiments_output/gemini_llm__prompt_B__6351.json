It was established in 1900 at the initiative of Professor Walery Jaworski by a resolution of the Medical Faculty of UJ on April 27. The collections were largely sourced from donations from doctors and professors affiliated with UJ, such as Edward Korczyński, Adam Wrzosek (library), Józef Bogusz (library, collection of tools and instruments), as well as their families, including Ludwik Bierkowski, Tytus Chałubiński, and Adam Bochenek. Jaworski himself also donated his private collections to the museum. After the first year of operation, the museum had 1,222 items (1,769 exhibits), and by 1905 – 4,617.\n\nIn 1920, the Department of the History and Philosophy of Medicine was established, directed by Professor Władysław Szumowski, who focused on the systematization and display of the already significant collections. Converted into a Chair, it did not, however, have a permanent location, and the premises obtained in 1937 for the Chair and Museum on M. Kopernika Street 7 were unsuitable for setting up an exhibition. The secured collections there survived the occupation in an undamaged state. Between 1951 and 1956, the Chair was transformed into the Department of Health Organization, which saved the collections during a time when all departments of the history of medicine were being dissolved. The re-establishment of the Chair did not solve the space problem – it was not until 1990 that premises in the House of the Medical Society at 4 Radziwiłłowska Street were allocated for the Museum. The new headquarters were officially opened on June 16, 1992, by the then rector of CM UJ, Professor Andrzej Szczeklik. \n\nThe museum's collections include, among other things, incunabula, documents, manuscripts, commemorative medals, medical instruments, and portraits. An important part of the collection is a large set of surgical instruments and a collection of plaster casts from Professor Bierkowski's anatomic-pathological office, as well as a collection of the history of diseases from the clinic of Professor Maciej Józef Brodowicz. \n\nVisiting the museum is possible by prior arrangement of the date.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : mburbani@cyf-kr.edu.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Anatomii;Museum of Anatomy;Muzeum Katedry Anatomii Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego Collegium Medicum;Orvoslástörténeti Múzeum\nid : 2845\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://wawel.krakow.pl/wystawa-stala/wawel-zaginiony-1\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9363047 50.0540886)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Wawel Zaginiony – an archaeological-architectural reserve and permanent exhibition, located in a former German building from the 1940s, built on the site of the former royal kitchens at Wawel.
