Centrum C 3, in Aleja Róż, initially as a café. It is referred to as \"iconic.\"  \nThe buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café \"Stylowa\" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant \"Arkadia,\" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  \nIn 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide \"Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta\" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, \"Stylowa\" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  \nFrom 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to \"Stylowa,\" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of \"Stylowa\" and was going to \"Arkadia,\" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in \"Stylowa\" would jokingly order \"pork chop for Lenin\" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at \"Stylowa\" and was punished with a one-year ban.  \nAfter the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, \"Stylowa,\" due to its preserved \"People's Poland color,\" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : restaurant\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : polish\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : pedestrian_zone\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : no\nname : Stylowa\nid : 95\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo 10:00-15:00; Tu-Su 09:00-19:00\nwebsite : https://muzeumkrakowa.pl/oddzialy/fabryka-emalia-oskara-schindlera\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.962274 50.0475253, 19.9622646 50.0474696, 19.9622602 50.0474411, 19.9617403 50.0474216, 19.9611886 50.0473524, 19.9611298 50.0475405, 19.9615336 50.0475251, 19.9615305 50.0475025, 19.9617119 50.0475227, 19.9617191 50.0475027, 19.9619287 50.0475128, 19.962274 50.0475253))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory (Polish: Fabryka Emalia Oskara Schindlera) is a former metal item factory in Kraków.

Originally, it was located on the southern side of the former Kazimierski Market, of which a small fragment is the present Plac Wolnica. Residential buildings within the market are not an exception; similar ones were located in the Main Market Square in Kraków (or the \"merchant houses\" in the Old Market in Poznań). The Dom Esterki is the only preserved residential house that originally stood at the Kazimierz market (a house formed by the merging of two smaller ones). The oldest part of the cellars of this originally Gothic building dates back to the 14th century, and then the building was remodeled almost every century (the last time in 1876, while its current appearance is mainly due to the renovations carried out at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries). To this day, fragments of Gothic stonework from around 1430 and slightly later (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) have been preserved. In the late 18th century, wooden ceilings were made, and rich polychromy of the walls and ceiling rosettes also date from this period. In the 16th century, the house belonged to the architect and builder working at the court of Polish King Sigismund the Old, and Kazimierz councilor Bartolomeo Bereccy, and later to his daughter Anna. The building is currently topped with a rarely encountered classicist broken roof (the so-called Krakow roof). The name of the building refers to the legend of Esterka, the Jewish bride of King Casimir the Great. Her name is also associated with several other places in Kraków: Ester Street, Esterka Mound, and a small tenement that stood until 1932 at the junction of Szczepański Square and Reformacka Street. Since a thorough renovation took place from 1978 to 1985, Dom Esterki has housed a branch of the nearby Ethnographic Museum. Previously, in the 1950s and 60s, a coffee bar \"Esterka\" operated here.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Etnograficzne (Dom Esterki);Néprajzi Múzeum (Esterka-ház)\nid : 3540\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8958066 50.1235526, 19.8957283 50.1236371, 19.8956141 50.1237774, 19.8954784 50.1240811, 19.8954087 50.1241273, 19.8953712 50.1241711, 19.8953551 50.1242187, 19.89539 50.124275, 19.8959546 50.124685, 19.8964093 50.1249883, 19.8964842 50.1250553, 19.8965646 50.1250837, 19.8966584 50.1250858, 19.8967536 50.1250748, 19.8968247 50.1250501, 19.8988446 50.1247998, 19.898931 50.1247695, 19.8989707 50.1247108, 19.8989729 50.1246555, 19.8989718 50.124569, 19.8990823 50.1242494, 19.8992193 50.1239942, 19.8992556 50.1238546, 19.8992497 50.1237641, 19.8991847 50.1237098, 19.899113 50.1236739, 19.8989811 50.1236632, 19.8982268 50.1236766, 19.8980867 50.1236275, 19.8979995 50.1236461, 19.897938 50.1236901, 19.8977665 50.1239124, 19.8973259 50.1238353, 19.8970812 50.1237894, 19.8959081 50.1235715, 19.8958066 50.1235526))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 44 Tonie – a historic armored fort of the Kraków Fortress. It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Fort 44 \"Tonie\"\nid : 3693\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8584723 50.0817947)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Kraków Młynówka – a train station in Kraków on line number 118, serving passenger trains that transport travelers from the Main Station in Kraków to John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : station\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kraków Młynówka\nid : 7616\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.945394 50.0516033, 19.9454004 50.0515889, 19.9453995 50.0515765, 19.9453944 50.0515663, 19.945383 50.0515575, 19.945366 50.0515511, 19.9447594 50.0513979, 19.9447517 50.0513964, 19.944738 50.0513953, 19.9447284 50.0513959, 19.9447131 50.0513988, 19.9447 50.0514053, 19.944692 50.0514117, 19.9446876 50.0514175, 19.9445068 50.0517222, 19.9445042 50.0517311, 19.9445051 50.0517475, 19.9445136 50.0517622, 19.9445336 50.0517762, 19.9450401 50.052066, 19.9450575 50.0520709, 19.9450689 50.0520719, 19.9450792 50.0520716, 19.9450928 50.0520689, 19.9451023 50.0520657, 19.9451181 50.0520565, 19.9451238 50.0520492, 19.945394 50.0516033), (19.9451672 50.0517511, 19.9451631 50.0517563, 19.9451548 50.0517622, 19.9450259 50.0518261, 19.9449137 50.0518354, 19.9448076 50.0518085, 19.9447351 50.0517506, 19.9447149 50.0516497, 19.9447159 50.0516423, 19.9447206 50.0516346, 19.944729 50.0516285, 19.944854 50.0515615, 19.9449721 50.0515517, 19.9450765 50.0515794, 19.9451463 50.0516377, 19.9451695 50.0517436, 19.9451672 50.0517511))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Plac Nowy, commonly known as the Jewish Square – a square in Kraków, in the district I Old Town, in Kazimierz.
