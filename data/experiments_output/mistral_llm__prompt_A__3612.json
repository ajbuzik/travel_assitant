It is located at Floriańska Street in Kraków, the capital of the Lesser Poland region.\nJama Michalika (lit. Michalik's Den in Polish) is one of the oldest Kraków cafes. It was founded in 1895 by Jan Apolinary Michalik as Cukiernia Lwowska (Lwów Confiserie). The current name, also translated as the Michalik's Cave, came into existence because initially Michalik could afford only a single room in the back, without any windows. The central location in the Ulica Floriańska 45 as well as the patisserie offering and the invitation to students from the nearby Academy of Fine Arts to dine there free of charge in exchange for their small works of art, the cafe became quickly popular.\n\nIn 1905, the cabaret Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) began staging performances at the café. As a highlight of every cabaret evening was the appearance of a puppet theatre designed and produced for widely popular shows against bigotry and imperial censorship, by Bronisława Janowska among others. Some of the puppets depicted prominent Cracovians. A selection of those historic puppets are displayed at the cafe. The interior is decorated with Art Nouveau furniture, mirrors, stained glass, lamps and cabinets.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : cafe\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Floriańska\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kawiarnia Jama Michalika;Kaffee \"Jama Michalika\" Michaels Grotte\nid : 449\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : 24/7\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.936759 50.059086)\nhistoric : memorial\nwiki_summary_en : The monument of Józef Dietl – a monument by Xawery Dunikowski located at All Saints Square, in front of the town hall building in Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : yes\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Józef Dietl;Josef-Dietl-Denkmal;Xawery Dunikowski\nid : 2438\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9348457 50.0536056, 19.9347951 50.0535932, 19.9347817 50.0536166, 19.9346338 50.0535787, 19.9346237 50.0535586, 19.9346119 50.0535639, 19.9346223 50.0535835, 19.934568 50.0536703, 19.9345483 50.0536758, 19.9345549 50.0536843, 19.9345758 50.0536785, 19.9347237 50.0537143, 19.9347169 50.0537272, 19.9347323 50.0537319, 19.9347465 50.0537034, 19.9347853 50.0537119, 19.9347772 50.0537256, 19.9347906 50.0537287, 19.9347987 50.0537147, 19.9348427 50.0537246, 19.9348528 50.0537375, 19.9348649 50.0537325, 19.934855 50.0537214, 19.9348852 50.0536675, 19.9349067 50.0536625, 19.9349017 50.0536542, 19.9348795 50.0536593, 19.9348361 50.0536476, 19.9348585 50.0536088, 19.9348457 50.0536056), (19.9348234 50.0536437, 19.934821 50.0536433, 19.9348142 50.0536514, 19.9348701 50.0536668, 19.9348437 50.0537156, 19.9347504 50.053695, 19.934752 50.0536901, 19.9347404 50.053687, 19.9347293 50.0537058, 19.9345843 50.0536704, 19.9346342 50.0535892, 19.9347767 50.0536251, 19.9347637 50.053645, 19.9347772 50.0536484, 19.9347819 50.0536422, 19.9348007 50.0536476, 19.9348047 50.0536394, 19.9347873 50.053634, 19.9348044 50.0536041, 19.9348416 50.0536134, 19.9348234 50.0536437))\nhistoric : church\nwiki_summary_en : St. George's Chapel (Polish: Kaplica św.

The chapel was governed by the dean and canons of Wawel.\nThe chapel was located in the outer courtyard of the castle hill. There are not many historical sources. One of the earliest sources mentions it as a chapel of the fortification. The chapel's first mention was around 1243 and the brick structure dates to the reign of King Casimir III the Great. It consisted of one nave with a rectangular sanctuary from the east and vestry to the south. At the nave was a large crypt. \nIt was demolished during the Austrian rule in 1804, when the occupying garrison created a large space to hold their drills. The remains of the chapel were excavated after World War II.

It lies along the Małopolska Wooden Architecture Trail.  \nThe chapel was rebuilt on the site of the previous one, which was destroyed by fires in 1587 and 1656. It was constructed in the 17th century, between 1689 and 1690, under the abbess Justyna Oraczowska. It was consecrated in honor of Saint Margaret.  \nIn the 19th century, it was first linked to the site of former pagan cults, just like the earlier parish church of the Holy Savior. From then on, it was referred to as Gontyny.  \nThe interiors of the chapel once featured three altars: of Saint Margaret, Saint Helena, and Justyna, the patroness of the abbess Justyna Oraczowska. /Catalog of Art Monuments in Poland/  \nPaintings depicting scenes from the life of Blessed Bronisława and portraits of her ancestors.  \nThe existing building has undergone numerous renovations, and studies conducted by the Wooden Structure Conservation Works in Warsaw confirmed that it is a 17th-century chapel. /Aldona Sudacka/  \nCurrently, the chapel is open for visits during the summer season from May to the end of September on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 6:00 PM, and on Sundays from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The monument stands at the place where, according to tradition, Father Karol Wojtyła set off with academic youth on a hiking trip to the Mnikowska Valley to participate in Vespers sung at the foot of the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, painted on the rock.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : place_of_worship\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : no\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kaplica Świętej Małgorzaty i Świętej Judyty;Szent Margit kápolna\nid : 3612\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8927573 50.0549175, 19.8927652 50.0549712, 19.8927596 50.0549718, 19.8927567 50.054976, 19.8927417 50.0549762, 19.8927345 50.0549762, 19.8927327 50.0549692, 19.8927283 50.0549674, 19.8927348 50.0549618, 19.8927402 50.0549623, 19.892739 50.0549576, 19.8927363 50.054958, 19.8927352 50.0549515, 19.8927382 50.0549512, 19.8927363 50.0549373, 19.8927332 50.0549371, 19.8927322 50.054931, 19.8927357 50.0549305, 19.8927347 50.0549249, 19.8927325 50.0549246, 19.8927251 50.054929, 19.8927178 50.0549242, 19.8927194 50.0549233, 19.8927149 50.0549195, 19.8927093 50.0549229, 19.8927059 50.0549206, 19.8926861 50.0549196, 19.8926819 50.0549218, 19.8926767 50.0549182, 19.8926723 50.0549202, 19.8926745 50.0549217, 19.8926653 50.054927, 19.8926614 50.0549243, 19.8926427 50.0549237, 19.8926387 50.0549263, 19.8926318 50.0549212, 19.8926321 50.0549089, 19.8926339 50.054904, 19.8926293 50.0549007, 19.8926247 50.0548973, 19.892617 50.0548978, 19.8925982 50.0548971, 19.8925906 50.0548922, 19.8925953 50.0548897, 19.8925954 50.0548778, 19.8925921 50.0548746, 19.8926 50.0548699, 19.8926189 50.0548705, 19.8926269 50.0548718, 19.8926321 50.0548688, 19.8926373 50.0548657, 19.8926368 50.0548606, 19.8926384 50.0548481, 19.8926465 50.0548438, 19.8926497 50.0548466, 19.8926683 50.0548471, 19.8926727 50.0548447, 19.8926781 50.0548502, 19.8926831 50.0548545, 19.8926884 50.0548511, 19.8926914 50.0548529, 19.8927119 50.0548539, 19.8927153 50.0548518, 19.8927208 50.0548557, 19.892727 50.0548529, 19.892726 50.0548521, 19.892732 50.0548469, 19.8927384 50.0548515, 19.8927413 50.0548516, 19.8927429 50.0548462, 19.8927398 50.0548457, 19.8927414 50.0548396, 19.8927453 50.05484, 19.8927475 50.0548331, 19.8927496 50.0548261, 19.8927456 50.0548256, 19.8927473 50.0548191, 19.8927506 50.0548192, 19.8927528 50.054814, 19.8927472 50.0548148, 19.8927423 50.0548093, 19.8927461 50.0548077, 19.8927491 50.0548006, 19.8927552 50.0548014, 19.8927692 50.054803, 19.8927708 50.0548044, 19.8927693 50.0548102, 19.8927998 50.054808, 19.8928256 50.0548176, 19.8928311 50.0548255, 19.8928373 50.0548348, 19.8928315 50.0548532, 19.8928194 50.0548581, 19.8928291 50.0548875, 19.8928289 50.0549193, 19.8927573 50.0549175))\nhistoric : yes\nwiki_summary_en : Chapel of Blessed Bronisława is a neo-Gothic Roman Catholic chapel in Kraków, Poland, erected in 1856–61 within the walls of a military citadel constructed during the Austrian Partition of Poland by the Habsburg monarchy. The chapel was meant as a replacement for the Polish 18th-century church demolished by the Austrians in 1854 during the construction of the stronghold in the Zwierzyniec district. \nThe imperial \"Kościuszko\" citadel surrounded the ancient burial mound and Polish national monument called Kościuszko Mound. The actual mound was used as an observation point by the army. The new chapel, based on design by Feliks Księżarski, was a result of the determined requests for a replacement made by the Polish Committee for the Construction of the Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : place_of_worship\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Aleja Jerzego Waszyngtona\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kaplica pw.

Rock climbing is practiced on it.  \nSadystówka is located in the area of the Skałki Twardowskiego nature reserve, one of the recreational areas of Kraków. It is well known to Kraków climbers, but it is absent from climbing guides, not marked on maps, and has very little information available online. Sadystówka is a rock wall that is a remnant of the former Kapelanka limestone quarry. Its height does not exceed 5 meters, but it is 80 meters long. It is perfectly vertical, with some parts slightly overhanging. In the middle section, a small chamber was carved out, which is closed by a door.  \nClimbing on Sadystówka has been taking place for about 100 years. In 1910, Mieczysław Świerz and Kazimierz Piotrowski conducted climbing exercises for mountaineers at Zakrzówek, and later, climbers from Kraków climbed here. This long-standing practice of climbing has caused all the holds to be very polished. There is only one climbing route on Sadystówka – but it is long, as it runs not upward but across, traversing the entire length of the wall. It has been rated at VI.3 on the Polish scale. One advantage of Sadystówka is that climbing is possible even in winter, at negative temperatures, as long as the sun shines on the wall. In the past, when there were no artificial climbing walls, some climbers trained on it all year round, allowing them to maintain their form in spring. Mathematician Tomek Opozda completed Sadystówka ten times non-stop.  \nOn Sadystówka, the holds shine like freshly polished bathroom tiles and can be considered a Kraków standard of polishing, yet it remains a climbing object. In its vicinity, there are several other climbing walls with vertical surfaces: Baba Jaga, Ciąża, Freney, Problemówka, Szara Ścianka. The height of some exceeds 30 meters.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : cliff\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Sadystówka\nid : 11536\n\n",
