Centrum C 3, in Aleja Róż, initially as a café. It is referred to as \"iconic.\"  \nThe buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café \"Stylowa\" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant \"Arkadia,\" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  \nIn 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide \"Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta\" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, \"Stylowa\" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  \nFrom 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to \"Stylowa,\" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of \"Stylowa\" and was going to \"Arkadia,\" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in \"Stylowa\" would jokingly order \"pork chop for Lenin\" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at \"Stylowa\" and was punished with a one-year ban.  \nAfter the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, \"Stylowa,\" due to its preserved \"People's Poland color,\" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : restaurant\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : polish\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : pedestrian_zone\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : no\nname : Stylowa\nid : 95\n\nphone : +48 12 3957065\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Tu-Th 09:00-17:00; Fr-Su 09:00-19:00; PH off\nwebsite : https://www.cogiteon.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : MULTIPOLYGON (((19.9898496 50.0852354, 19.9903389 50.0851391, 19.9904527 50.0851167, 19.9904573 50.0851263, 19.990487 50.0851888, 19.9898762 50.0853096, 19.9898587 50.0853131, 19.9899393 50.0853806, 19.9901311 50.0855413, 19.9903675 50.0857393, 19.990383 50.0857363, 19.990389 50.0857351, 19.9911684 50.0855815, 19.9911743 50.0855803, 19.9911902 50.0855772, 19.9912277 50.0851656, 19.9912391 50.0850402, 19.991223 50.0850434, 19.990689 50.0851489, 19.9906594 50.0850866, 19.9906548 50.0850769, 19.9907686 50.0850545, 19.9908231 50.0850437, 19.9911631 50.0849767, 19.9911792 50.0849736, 19.9912005 50.0849694, 19.9912303 50.0849635, 19.9912472 50.0849602, 19.9912491 50.0849235, 19.991256 50.0847964, 19.9912452 50.0847985, 19.9912221 50.0848031, 19.9905694 50.0849319, 19.9904761 50.0849507, 19.990402 50.0849657, 19.989673 50.0851088, 19.9896443 50.0851145, 19.989632 50.0851169, 19.9897839 50.0852483, 19.9897996 50.0852452, 19.9898496 50.0852354)), ((19.9907781 50.0859263, 19.990934 50.0858956, 19.9911429 50.0858543, 19.9911496 50.085853, 19.9911649 50.08585, 19.9911744 50.0857455, 19.9911824 50.0856577, 19.991167 50.0856607, 19.9908515 50.0857231, 19.9906191 50.085769, 19.9904595 50.0858006, 19.9904444 50.0858036, 19.9905288 50.0858746, 19.9906258 50.0859563, 19.9906409 50.0859534, 19.9906469 50.0859522, 19.9907781 50.0859263)), ((19.9911563 50.0859308, 19.9911422 50.0859336, 19.990969 50.0859679, 19.9908122 50.0859989, 19.9907296 50.0860153, 19.9907174 50.0860177, 19.9907028 50.0860206, 19.9910015 50.0862716, 19.9911174 50.086369, 19.9911277 50.0862533, 19.9911465 50.0860414, 19.9911563 50.0859308)))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Małopolskie Centrum Nauki Cogiteon – a science center, a cultural institution of the Małopolskie Voivodeship. Its aim is to educate through play and to engage in independent or team scientific experiments, research projects, and social initiatives. \n\nFormally, the institution was established in December 2017. By mid-2022, a headquarters is to be built in the Krakow district of Czyżyny, according to a design prepared by the Wrocław office of Heinle, Wischer und Partner Architekci. The project was selected through an architectural competition, with the results announced on February 17, 2018. The estimated value of the project is approximately 120 million PLN. \n\nThe building will include, among other things, a permanent exhibition, the main theme of which will be humanity. Until the construction investment is realized, the Center intends to carry out its mission, among others, through the activities of the Mobile Exhibition \"Naukowiej.\" The exhibition has been operating since February 2019 and is housed in a retractable trailer. It features several exhibits dedicated to the theme of air. The exhibition aims to visit all municipalities in the Małopolskie Voivodeship. \n\nDespite the lack of finality of the decision regarding the entry in the register of cultural landscape monuments and the absence of consideration of appeals against the issued building permit, construction work began at the end of March 2021. In the second week of May of the same year, the final decision on the entry into the register was signed, while all appeals were dismissed. \n\nOn April 5, 2024, the general contractor handed over the building of the Science Center. At the same time, the dates for the opening ceremony were announced for June 21 and 22, 2024.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : MCN Cogiteon\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Izydora Stella-Sawickiego\ncontact_twitter : https://x.com/cogiteon\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : https://www.facebook.com/cogiteon\nzoo : nan\nemail : biuro@cogiteon.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : https://www.instagram.com/cogiteon.pl\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : science\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Małopolskie Centrum Nauki Cogiteon;Małopolska Science Center Cogiteon;MCN Cogiteon;Cogiteon\nid : 3420\n\nphone : +48 12 3461285\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Apr: Mo-Fr 08:30-19:00; Apr: Sa,Su 10:00-19:00; May-Aug: Mo-Fr 08:30-20:30; May-Aug: Sa,Su 10:00-20:30; Sep: Mo-Fr 08:30-19:00; Sep: Sa,Su 10:00-19:00; Oct: Mo-Fr 08:30-15:00; Oct: Sa,Su 10:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://www.ogroddoswiadczen.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9985725 50.0673696, 19.9984943 50.0672579, 19.9981817 50.0672351, 19.9979144 50.0672291, 19.9976228 50.0672339, 19.9975633 50.0670638, 19.9975564 50.0668631, 19.9975574 50.066686, 19.9975808 50.0666119, 19.9975368 50.0666075, 19.9975044 50.0666026, 19.9974661 50.0665993, 19.9972027 50.0665693, 19.9970074 50.0668589, 19.9969313 50.0670857, 19.9968658 50.0678185, 19.9962196 50.0677658, 19.9959196 50.0677955, 19.9958464 50.0683027, 19.9958445 50.0683161, 19.9958428 50.0683305, 19.9958406 50.0683393, 19.9955001 50.0683116, 19.9951376 50.0682944, 19.9944192 50.0685769, 19.9949942 50.0696008, 19.9952239 50.0696476, 19.9956017 50.0696658, 19.9960188 50.0697095, 19.9966388 50.0697589, 19.996776 50.0697597, 19.9968766 50.0697654, 19.9973545 50.0697038, 19.997531 50.0696847, 19.997571 50.0696752, 19.9976736 50.0696583, 19.9976836 50.0696568, 19.9976948 50.0696549, 19.9978249 50.0696337, 19.9979191 50.0696172, 19.9986918 50.0682626, 19.9987696 50.0681269, 19.9987436 50.0677313, 19.9985725 50.0673696))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Garden of Experiences named after Stanisław Lem in Kraków (commonly known as the \"Krakow Garden of Experiences\") is an educational park established in 2007 in Kraków.

Together with the Sandomierska tower, it forms a unique group of so-called fire towers.\n\nIt was probably erected between 1447 and 1460 during the reign of Casimir Jagiellonian to strengthen the castle's defenses after the spread of new types of artillery. The lower floors are made of stone, while the upper ones are made of brick. Vertical communication was provided by stairs located within the thickness of the wall. Shortly after its construction, a decision was made to raise the tower by covering it with a high steep roof. Around 1517, a new arrow slit was cut into the wall of the ground floor. In 1534, the tower was connected to the southern wing of the royal palace, and the lower floors were remodeled, among other purposes, to accommodate a chamber for the \"young king,\" i.e., Sigismund Augustus. According to Bielski's Chronicle, in 1595, the highest floor above the corbels was lowered \"due to the great weight it had.\" At that time, a finish with panel divides and round windows was created. Its oldest name, Lubranka, comes from the name of the castle's attorney general, Grzegorz from Lubraniec. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was also called Olbramka, Wolbromka, and Skarbowa. Ultimately, the name Senatorska Tower was adopted. In October 1536, a fire destroyed the tower, which was renovated between 1540 and 1543. In 1584, near the tower, Samuel Zborowski was executed.\n\nThe tower has been repeatedly damaged by fires, including in 1656 during the Swedish occupation, and renovated. Around 1858, it was remodeled (like other Wawel towers) by the Austrians, with the removal of the sloping roof and the introduction of a pseudo-Gothic crenellation. Further unfavorable modifications occurred during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1943, when the latrine bay was removed, a window was cut into the ground floor, the vault in the basement was removed, and a fireplace was placed where the historical entrance used to be. Around 1965, the damaged pseudo-Gothic crenellation from the partitioning times was replaced. The repeatedly proposed restoration of the historical shape of the tower with the roof covering was realized only in 2002-2003 according to the design of architect Piotr Stępień in cooperation with Dr. engineer Stanisław Karczmarczyk. The roof was covered with monk-nun tiles, and the latrine bay destroyed by the German occupiers was reconstructed. These works were combined with the conservation of the entire wall of the tower.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Baszta Senatorska;Senatorerturm;Сенаторская башня;Szenátori-torony\nid : 3501\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8485789 50.0499758)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Pustelnik (355 m above sea level) is the second highest hill (after Sowińca) in the area of Kraków, located in the western part of the Sowińca massif within the Wolski Forest.
