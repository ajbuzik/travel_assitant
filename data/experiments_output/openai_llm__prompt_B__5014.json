They were created en masse in the 1960s and 1970s during the thaw when the rules of socialist realism ceased to apply. The authorities of the newly created city provided ideal working conditions for young creators. The Housing Cooperative “Hutnik” played a significant role in popularizing art and creating an artistic environment in Nowa Huta, collaborating with the Management Board of the District ZPAP and the Creative Association “Nowa Huta,” which was initiated by Janusz Trzebiatowski in 1969. Young artists, mostly graduates of the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, were provided with apartments, studios, and scholarships; in return, their sculptures began to adorn the green spaces of Nowa Huta. The works created during this period have varying artistic value and styles. Artists used diverse techniques and materials. Many sculptures resulting from this initiative have been preserved in Nowa Huta. In 2018, as part of a project under the patronage of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, a trail of outdoor sculptures and installations in Nowa Huta was created.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : artwork\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Organy;Lucjan Orzech\nid : 3149\n\nphone : +48 12 656 36 70\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://borek.ckpodgorza.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9044574 50.0004421, 19.9045191 50.0004311, 19.9045275 50.0004506, 19.9046954 50.0004207, 19.9047392 50.0005223, 19.9045096 50.0005632, 19.9041602 50.0006254, 19.9037671 50.0006954, 19.9035944 50.0007262, 19.9033695 50.0007662, 19.9033386 50.0006946, 19.9033042 50.0007007, 19.9032921 50.0006727, 19.9035009 50.0006355, 19.903496 50.0006241, 19.9035465 50.0006151, 19.9035422 50.000605, 19.9044574 50.0004421))\nhistoric : castle\nwiki_summary_en : Fort 52 \"Borek\" – one of the forts of the Kraków Fortress. It was built between 1885 and 1886, most likely designed by Daniel Salis-Soglio, and based on its model, three forts were constructed in the Przemyśl Fortress. Fort 52 \"Borek\" belonged to the VIII defensive sector of the Kraków Fortress, covering the areas between the valleys of the Wilga and the upper Vistula. It is a double-ring artillery fort. The higher rampart was intended for artillery, while the lower one was for infantry and light guns. The caponiers were equipped with machine guns and later with automatic rifles. The fort features the first three-level underground intersection in Kraków for the movement of soldiers and transportation of armaments.  \nThe fort's task was to guard the exits of main roads and to defend the Vienna route (now known as Zakopianka) and approaches to the fortress ring from the direction of Libertów. The fort did not participate in the battles of World War I.  \nDuring World War II, Russian and French prisoners were held in the fort. On December 26, 1944, an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was forced to land with its landing gear retracted in front of the fort. It had been damaged during a raid on the refinery in Blechhammer (now: Blachownia, part of Kędzierzyn-Koźle), and its crew attempted to reach areas controlled by the Red Army. Until the 1990s, there was a vehicle and equipment base of a construction cooperative located here. For several years, it remained unused and was in poor technical condition. From 2013 to 2022, the fort underwent revitalization, and since July 30, 2022, it has been managed by the Podgórze Cultural Center and is the seat of the Polish Song Library. In the place where the American bomber landed in 1944, trees grew after the war. In June 2022, the area was developed and made available to residents as a park.  \nFort 52 Borek is located between Korpala, Władysław Krygowski, and Forteczna streets in Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : arts_centre\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Forteczna\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : info@ckpodgorza.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Centrum Kultury Podgórza - Fort Borek;fort Borek\nid : 3582\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (20.1282485 50.0903614)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Kraków Nowa Huta – a technical station of PKP Polish State Railways located in Nowa Huta, in Kraków, in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland.

The mound is assumed to be the resting place of the legendary princess Wanda. According to one version of the story, she committed suicide by drowning in the Vistula river to avoid unwanted marriage with a German. The mound is located close to the spot on the river bank where her body was found. Archaeological studies, conducted on site in 1913 and in mid-1960, did not provide any conclusive evidence of the mound's age or purpose.\nThe mound base, some 50 metres (164 ft) in diameter, is at 238 metres (781 ft) AMSL, and its height is 14 metres (46 ft). Unlike the other three mounds in Kraków, this one is not located on a natural hill.\nThe first written record of the mound comes from the 13th century. Within two kilometres (one mile) of the mound-site in 1225 a monastery was built by the bishop of Kraków, Iwo Odrowąż, called the Mogiła Abbey, which is still active today. In 1860 it became a part of Austro-Hungarian fortifications, pulled down only in 1968-1970. In 1890 a monument designed by Jan Matejko was erected at the top: an eagle on a plinth decorated with a relief of a sword and a distaff, below the inscription \"Wanda\".\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kopiec Wandy\nid : 11377\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8485789 50.0499758)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Pustelnik (355 m above sea level) is the second highest hill (after Sowińca) in the area of Kraków, located in the western part of the Sowińca massif within the Wolski Forest.

It serves as a junction for a short northern ridge that ends at Łysa Góra. The Kraków Zoo is located on Pustelnik.  \nAt the summit of Pustelnik is the Polana Jacka Malczewskiego, which he often visited. At that time, the hill provided a great view, but currently, trees obscure the vistas.

In various publications, it is also known by other names: Zakrzówek, Zrąb Zakrzówka, Twardowski's Rocks, Southern Ridge. In the past, the hill was part of the village of Zakrzówek, which was incorporated into Krakow; it is currently located in Krakow, in District VIII Dębniki, in the Krakow Bridge macroregion. \n\nFor several hundred years, limestone has been extracted from Krzemionki Zakrzowskie for construction purposes, with the most intensive mining taking place since the early 20th century. At that time, there were four quarries on the hill: Berger's Quarry, Twardowski's Rocks, Kapelanka, and Zakrzówek. The largest was the Zakrzówek quarry. It left behind a vast depression in the terrain, which quickly filled with water after mining ceased. Today, it is a popular recreation area for Krakow residents, known as Zakrzówek Reservoir. Most of the hill has become a recreational area of Krakow called Uroczysko Skałki Twardowskiego. In its northeastern part, there is a dry Kapelanka quarry, whose rocky walls, resembling rock walls, are a very popular climbing spot not only for Krakow climbers. Climbers distinguish among them the rocks: Baba Jaga, Ciąża, Freney, Niski Mur, Problemówka, Rdzawe Zacięcie, Szara Ścianka, Sadystówka. The remaining part of Krzemionki is covered by forest. A dense network of walking paths with benches for tourists and trash bins runs through the hill. \n\nAmong the rocks of Krzemionki Zakrzowskie, there are several caves, the largest being Twardowski's Cave, located in the western part of Krzemionki. The remaining caves and shelters include: Jasna Cave, Kogut Cave, Musza Cave, Niska Cave, the cave under Nyża, the cave before Problemówka, Pychowicka Cave, the cave in the Anastomoses, Wywiew Cave, the cave with Balls, Magazyn Cave, Zbójnickie Window, Rurka, Shelter above Sadystówka, Shelter next to the Anastomoses, Tunnel in Pychowice.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Zakrzówek\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Krzemionki Zakrzowskie;Zakrzówek\nid : 11452\n\n",
