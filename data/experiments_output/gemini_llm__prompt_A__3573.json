Its aim is to educate through play and to engage in independent or team scientific experiments, research projects, and social initiatives. \n\nFormally, the institution was established in December 2017. By mid-2022, a headquarters is to be built in the Krakow district of Czyżyny, according to a design prepared by the Wrocław office of Heinle, Wischer und Partner Architekci. The project was selected through an architectural competition, with the results announced on February 17, 2018. The estimated value of the project is approximately 120 million PLN. \n\nThe building will include, among other things, a permanent exhibition, the main theme of which will be humanity. Until the construction investment is realized, the Center intends to carry out its mission, among others, through the activities of the Mobile Exhibition \"Naukowiej.\" The exhibition has been operating since February 2019 and is housed in a retractable trailer. It features several exhibits dedicated to the theme of air. The exhibition aims to visit all municipalities in the Małopolskie Voivodeship. \n\nDespite the lack of finality of the decision regarding the entry in the register of cultural landscape monuments and the absence of consideration of appeals against the issued building permit, construction work began at the end of March 2021. In the second week of May of the same year, the final decision on the entry into the register was signed, while all appeals were dismissed. \n\nOn April 5, 2024, the general contractor handed over the building of the Science Center. At the same time, the dates for the opening ceremony were announced for June 21 and 22, 2024.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : MCN Cogiteon\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Izydora Stella-Sawickiego\ncontact_twitter : https://x.com/cogiteon\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : https://www.facebook.com/cogiteon\nzoo : nan\nemail : biuro@cogiteon.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : https://www.instagram.com/cogiteon.pl\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : science\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Małopolskie Centrum Nauki Cogiteon;Małopolska Science Center Cogiteon;MCN Cogiteon;Cogiteon\nid : 3420\n\nphone : +48 12 633 36 35\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Apr 1-Sep 25: 09:00-19:00; Sep 26-Oct 24: 09:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://www.ogrod.uj.edu.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9553053 50.0635069, 19.9551534 50.0636739, 19.9557215 50.0638877, 19.9563054 50.0641008, 19.9565914 50.0642091, 19.9566708 50.0642392, 19.9568332 50.0640879, 19.9569111 50.0641164, 19.9571889 50.0638092, 19.9573189 50.0638587, 19.9578491 50.0639289, 19.9581296 50.0640216, 19.9581661 50.0640338, 19.9577808 50.0644209, 19.9586699 50.0645154, 19.9588331 50.064537, 19.9589071 50.0644544, 19.9590166 50.0643422, 19.9591658 50.0641095, 19.959208 50.0639995, 19.9592834 50.0637494, 19.9597804 50.0620162, 19.9597923 50.0619589, 19.959806 50.0618725, 19.9598019 50.0617846, 19.9597847 50.0616965, 19.9597281 50.0615576, 19.9593873 50.0605417, 19.9578759 50.0604764, 19.9578641 50.0608717, 19.9572542 50.0615179, 19.9568594 50.0618981, 19.9568081 50.0619621, 19.956074 50.0627145, 19.955799 50.0630257, 19.9556447 50.0631856, 19.9553053 50.0635069))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Botanic Garden of the Jagiellonian University (Polish: Ogród Botaniczny Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego) is a botanical garden, founded in 1783 in Kraków.

Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Królowej Jadwigi\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Dom Zwierzyniecki;Zwierzyniec House;Zwierzyniec Ház\nid : 3613\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.956023 50.0638095, 19.9558394 50.0637331, 19.9556558 50.0636567, 19.9557022 50.06361, 19.9557307 50.0636213, 19.9557754 50.0635753, 19.9557746 50.0635705, 19.955775 50.0635624, 19.9557794 50.0635547, 19.9557889 50.0635481, 19.9558036 50.0635455, 19.9558103 50.0635391, 19.9558377 50.0635515, 19.9558414 50.0635478, 19.9559687 50.0636006, 19.9560959 50.0636534, 19.9560891 50.06366, 19.9562267 50.0637167, 19.9562134 50.0637309, 19.9561953 50.0637498, 19.9561871 50.0637585, 19.9561725 50.0637739, 19.9561174 50.063751, 19.9560909 50.0637402, 19.956023 50.0638095))\nhistoric : castle\nwiki_summary_en : Collegium Śniadeckiego – a historic building of the Jagiellonian University located in Krakow, in the II Grzegórzki district at 27 Kopernik Street, in Wesoła. The college is named after the mathematician and astronomer Jan Śniadecki, who worked at the UJ during the period of the great reform by Kołłątaj. The building has a long history. As early as the 16th century, there was a Renaissance garden in this location, on the grounds of which a palace was built around 1600. Later, it came into the possession of the Czartoryski princes, who created their suburban residence (villa suburbana) here. In 1752, they sold it to the Jesuits, who carried out renovations for their college. After the dissolution of the order, the palace along with the garden passed into the ownership of the Krakow Academy. The palace was remodeled between 1788 and 1792 according to the design of Stanisław Zawadzki. An astronomical observatory was organized here at the inspiration of Śniadecki, and in 1783 a botanical garden was created around the building, where the then chemist and botanist Jan Dominik Jaśkiewicz worked. In the 1960s, the astronomical observatory was moved to Fort 38 \"Skała.\" Currently, the college houses the UJ Institute of Botany, the Botanical Garden Museum, as well as the facilities of the Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Research. Next to the building is the entrance to the Botanical Garden. On September 29, 1947, the building was entered into the heritage register. It is also included in the municipal register of monuments.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Mikołaja Kopernika\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Collegium Śniadeckiego;Botanic Garden Museum;Obserwatorium Astronomiczne UJ;http://www.ogrod.uj.edu.pl/english\nid : 3781\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9786077 50.0067478, 19.9786224 50.0067696, 19.9785516 50.0067888, 19.9785423 50.006788, 19.9785317 50.006784, 19.9785189 50.0067731, 19.9786077 50.0067478))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : no information\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : garden\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : no information\nid : 5032\n\n",
