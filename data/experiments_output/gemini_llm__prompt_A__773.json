Centrum C 3, in Aleja Róż, initially as a café. It is referred to as \"iconic.\"  \nThe buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café \"Stylowa\" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant \"Arkadia,\" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  \nIn 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide \"Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta\" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, \"Stylowa\" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  \nFrom 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to \"Stylowa,\" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of \"Stylowa\" and was going to \"Arkadia,\" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in \"Stylowa\" would jokingly order \"pork chop for Lenin\" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at \"Stylowa\" and was punished with a one-year ban.  \nAfter the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, \"Stylowa,\" due to its preserved \"People's Poland color,\" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : restaurant\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : polish\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : pedestrian_zone\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : no\nname : Stylowa\nid : 95\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://jamamichalika.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.940929 50.0640836)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Jama Michalika is a historic café in Kraków, Poland, established in 1895. It is located at Floriańska Street in Kraków, the capital of the Lesser Poland region.\nJama Michalika (lit. Michalik's Den in Polish) is one of the oldest Kraków cafes. It was founded in 1895 by Jan Apolinary Michalik as Cukiernia Lwowska (Lwów Confiserie). The current name, also translated as the Michalik's Cave, came into existence because initially Michalik could afford only a single room in the back, without any windows. The central location in the Ulica Floriańska 45 as well as the patisserie offering and the invitation to students from the nearby Academy of Fine Arts to dine there free of charge in exchange for their small works of art, the cafe became quickly popular.\n\nIn 1905, the cabaret Zielony Balonik (Green Balloon) began staging performances at the café. As a highlight of every cabaret evening was the appearance of a puppet theatre designed and produced for widely popular shows against bigotry and imperial censorship, by Bronisława Janowska among others. Some of the puppets depicted prominent Cracovians. A selection of those historic puppets are displayed at the cafe. The interior is decorated with Art Nouveau furniture, mirrors, stained glass, lamps and cabinets.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : cafe\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Floriańska\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kawiarnia Jama Michalika;Kaffee \"Jama Michalika\" Michaels Grotte\nid : 449\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo-Th 08:00-24:00, Fr-Su 08:00-01:00\nwebsite : https://zvis.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9357419 50.0617776)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Vis-à-vis is a bar located in Kraków's Old Town at Rynek Główny 29, in the tenement house \"Pod Blachą.\" It opened in 1978 in a space previously occupied by a fish store of the Fish Central. It is popularly known as Zwis. For years, it housed the informal office of Piwnica pod Baranami, a place for regular meetings of people associated with this cabaret. In front of the entrance stands a statue of Piotr Skrzynecki, the leader and master of ceremonies of the Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret, who was once a regular at this café. The statue was funded by composer Zbigniew Preisner. The sculpture was made by Grażyna Borkowska-Niemojewska and Łukasz Niemojewski. The café is still frequented mainly by artists: painters, poets, singers, sculptors, musicians, and actors, as well as photographers and filmmakers, and well-known figures from Kraków.\n\nNotable past and present patrons of the bar include poet Marcin Świetlicki (who immortalized the venue in his poem Do Zwisu i z powrotem and the crime novel Dwanaście), musician Andrzej Sikorowski, poet Tadeusz Śliwiak, critic Paweł Głowacki, musician Leszek Wójtowicz, and actor Jan Nowicki. A frequent visitor to Zwis was the famous Kloszard Zbigniew Fijałkowski, a character in numerous incidents and stories. Since 2007, bar patrons have published a magazine called \"Vis a vis,\" available in print and online. The illustrations for it are created by Iwona Siwek-Front, featuring daily stories about the Iced Gingerbread Woman with an impure soul. A comic by the artist that illustrates the social life of the local community and Vis-à-vis patrons hangs permanently in the bar. For many years, the bartender at Zwis has been Kraków poet Marek Wawrzyński, whose poetry collection – Na stronach – had its promotion at Piwnica.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : bar\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Rynek Główny\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : yes\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Vis-à-vis\nid : 1162\n\nphone : +48 12 421 35 00\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : http://www.hotelewam.pl/510-hotel-royal-krakow.html\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9393285 50.0545092)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Hotel Royal is a hotel in Krakow in the Old Town, located at 26–29 St. Gertrude Street.  \nThe hotel occupies four historic tenement houses; the oldest of them, from the 19th century, was built in the Art Nouveau style.
