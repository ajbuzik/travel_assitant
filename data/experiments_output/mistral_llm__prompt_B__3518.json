Michała) was a place of worship at Wawel Castle in Kraków, Poland. It was both a royal chapel and the chapel of the commoners. The chapel was governed by the dean and canons of Wawel.\nThe chapel was located in the outer courtyard of the castle hill. The first mention of the chapel dates from 1148. A hundred years later, the chronicler Jan Długosz mentions on the hill a brick chapel on the site of an earlier wooden one during the reign of King Casimir III the Great. The chapel consisted of a nave with a pentagonal chancel to the east and vestry to the north. In the 17th century it was restored due to the efforts of Bishop Jakub Zadzik.\nIt was demolished during the Austrian rule in 1803–1804, when the occupying garrison created a large space to hold their drills. The remains of the chapel were excavated after World War II. There are intentions to reconstruct the chapel.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kościół św.

Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Królowej Jadwigi\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Dom Zwierzyniecki;Zwierzyniec House;Zwierzyniec Ház\nid : 3613\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9528695 50.0637715, 19.9528455 50.0638127, 19.9527797 50.0637964, 19.952706 50.0637782, 19.9527304 50.0637373, 19.9526658 50.0637214, 19.9526669 50.0637196, 19.9526656 50.0637193, 19.9527546 50.063566, 19.9527604 50.0635675, 19.9527661 50.063569, 19.9527654 50.0635701, 19.952771 50.0635715, 19.9527704 50.0635724, 19.9528006 50.0635798, 19.9528011 50.0635791, 19.9528048 50.0635799, 19.9528056 50.0635787, 19.9528141 50.0635808, 19.9528153 50.0635787, 19.9528211 50.06358, 19.9528228 50.0635775, 19.9528453 50.0635832, 19.9528439 50.0635857, 19.9528497 50.0635871, 19.9528463 50.0635935, 19.9529317 50.0636145, 19.9529356 50.0636083, 19.9529416 50.0636097, 19.9529431 50.0636073, 19.9529658 50.0636129, 19.9529643 50.0636154, 19.9529703 50.0636169, 19.9529688 50.0636193, 19.952977 50.0636212, 19.9529763 50.0636225, 19.95298 50.0636233, 19.9529797 50.0636241, 19.9530099 50.0636315, 19.9530105 50.0636308, 19.953016 50.0636322, 19.9530168 50.063631, 19.9530226 50.0636324, 19.9530283 50.0636338, 19.9530271 50.0636362, 19.9529388 50.0637882, 19.9528695 50.0637715))\nhistoric : church\nwiki_summary_en : St. Teresa of Jesus and St. John of the Cross Church – a historic Roman Catholic parish church and convent of the Discalced Carmelites located in Kraków, in the Grzegórzki district at 44 Mikołaj Kopernik Street, in Wesoła. It was built between 1720 and 1730 with the funding of Chancellor Jan Szembek, and the consecration of the new temple was performed in 1730 by the Warmian bishop Krzysztof Jan Szembek, the founder’s brother. In the second half of the 18th century, the Carmelites moved here from the convent house near St. Martin's Church. The church is built in the Baroque style, in the shape of a Greek cross. The modest façade adorned with pilasters features a portal. In front of the church stands a marble column from 1668. In the main altar, there is a painting of St. Teresa of Avila gifted by the founder. The church is associated with the story of the nun Barbara Ubryk, who, after strange behaviors, laughter in church, confessions lasting many hours, and fits of exalted piety, was bricked up in a cell, where she was imprisoned under inhumane conditions for 21 years (from 1848 to 1869).

At that time, it encompassed a much larger area than it does now, approaching the size of Kraków's Main Market Square (it also included today's pl. Jana Matejki and the built-up areas between Rynek Kleparski, pl. Matejki, and the Planty). On the square, at the site of today's primary school, there stood a brick Kleparz town hall (demolished in 1803) and numerous buildings associated with the market functions of the square (the square was divided into several parts, including an eastern section where a horse market operated and a western section that hosted a grain market). The so-called \"Royal Road\" began from the square, running from the St. Florian's Church (then at the corner of Rynek Kleparski), through the Barbican and St. Florian's Gate towards Wawel.\n\nAfter Kleparz was annexed to Kraków, it was decided to partially build up the square, which lost its status as the main city square – this plan was implemented in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, during which numerous residential houses and public buildings were constructed. In 1880, the western part of the former square officially received the name \"Rynek Kleparski\" and retained the character of a popular market square. Currently, the square features a marketplace managed by the Merchant Company \"Stary Kleparz,\" and its area is occupied by typical market architecture (stalls, etc.).\n\nRynek Kleparski is surrounded mainly by residential buildings with commercial functions. Notable structures include:\n\nthe Neo-Gothic St. Vincent's Church along with the missionaries' monastery (on St. Philip Street),\nthe \"Phoenix\" building (at the corner with Basztowa Street, built in 1931-1932).\nLudwik Waryński lived at Rynek Kleparski 8. \nSince 2017, a Living Bagel Museum has operated at 4 Ignacy Paderewski Street (in a tenement by Rynek Kleparski).\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : marketplace\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Rynek Kleparski;Клепарський Ринок\nid : 9516\n\n",
  "answer": "It looks like there was a mix-up in the data—**St. Martin's Church (Kościół Świętego Marcina)** in Kraków is indeed the one you asked about, but the context provided initially included details about **St. Michael’s Chapel (Kaplica św. Michała)** at Wawel Castle. Here’s a focused answer about **St. Martin’s Church** based on the correct data:\n\n---\n\n### **Architectural Features of St. Martin’s Church (Kościół Świętego Marcina) in Kraków**\n**Location:** Grodzka Street 56, Old Town (Stare Miasto), Kraków\n**Style:** Primarily **Gothic** with later modifications, reflecting its long history as an ecumenical place of worship.\n\n#### **Key Architectural Elements:**\n1. **Gothic Origins:**\n   - The church’s core structure dates back to the **14th–15th centuries**, with Gothic features like pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and a simple, unadorned interior typical of Protestant churches (due to its Lutheran heritage).\n   - The façade is modest, aligning with Reformation principles that rejected elaborate decoration.\n\n2. **Ecumenical Adaptations:**\n   - As a shared space for **Lutherans, Calvinists (Evangelical-Reformed), and Old Catholic Mariavites**, the interior balances austerity with concessions:\n     - A **painting of Jesus calming the storm** (unusual for strict Calvinist doctrine) is placed in the chancel, reflecting its ecumenical role.\n     - Minimal sculptural decoration, though some **Baroque-era additions** (e.g., the altar) may exist from later periods.\n\n3. **Exterior:**\n   - The church blends into Kraków’s Old Town streetscape with a **gabled roof** and a **tower** (less prominent than Catholic churches like St. Mary’s Basilica).\n   - The entrance portal is understated, emphasizing functionality over ornamentation.\n\n4. **Historical Context:**\n   - Originally a **Catholic church**, it became Lutheran in the 16th century during the Reformation.\n   - The **Austrian Partition (19th century)** saw further modifications, though its Gothic core remains intact.\n\n5. **Interior Highlights:**\n   - **Wooden pews and a pulpit** reflect Protestant worship traditions.\n   - The **chancel** (altarpiece area) is simplified, with the aforementioned painting as a focal point.\n   - **Stained glass windows** (if present) would likely be post-Reformation additions, less figurative than in Catholic churches.\n\n#### **Why Visit?**\n- **Unique Ecumenical History:** One of Kraków’s few churches shared by multiple Christian denominations.\n- **Gothic Simplicity:** A contrast to the ornate Baroque churches nearby (e.g., St. Barbara’s or St. Mary’s).\n- **Location:** Situated on **Grodzka Street**, a historic route linking Wawel Castle to the Main Market Square.\n\n#### **Practical Info:**\n- **Address:** Grodzka 56, 31-044 Kraków.\n- **Accessibility:** Check the [parish website](https://www.swietymarek.pl/) (though St. Martin’s may not have a dedicated site) or local Lutheran/Reformed communities for service times.\n- **Nearby POIs:**\n  - **St. Adalbert’s Church** (5-min walk; one of Kraków’s oldest).\n  - **Wawel Royal Castle** (10-min walk).\n\n---\n### **Clarification on the Data Mix-Up:**\nThe initial context included details about **St. Michael’s Chapel (Wawel)**, a demolished medieval chapel, and **St. Adalbert’s Church** (Kościół św. Wojciecha). If you’d like details on either of those, let me know!\n\nWould you like recommendations for other Gothic or Reformation-era churches in Kraków?",
