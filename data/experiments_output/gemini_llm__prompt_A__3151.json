The park is located in the southeastern part of the Polish Aviation Park and covers an area of 6 hectares. The Garden of Experiences is an outdoor branch of the Museum of Engineering and Technology in Kraków. It was designed by the architectural office Ingarden&Ewy.  \nHistory:  \nThe Garden of Experiences named after Stanisław Lem in Kraków was established as the first initiative of its kind in Poland. It was initiated by the City of Kraków and the SIEMACHA Association, partners of the \"Nowa Huta – Nowa Szansa\" project within the framework of the EQUAL Community Initiative Operational Programme. The Kraków educational park is modeled after the \"Field of Sensory Experiences\" in Nuremberg and the Science and Industry Park La Villette in Paris.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : theme_park\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : biuro@ogroddoswiadczen.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Ogród Doświadczeń im.

A grade-separated intersection of the axial road (Waliszewskiego Street) and the access road to the Pękowice fort (Pękowicka Street), preventing congestion that could arise during combat when troops were simultaneously regrouping along both roads. This could have had very serious consequences, which is why about 100 years ago, a two-level intersection was built on the then far outskirts of the city. Recently, renovation work restored Czerwony Most to its original appearance.  \nBeneath Czerwony Most runs the Eagle's Nests Trail, which coincides with the former medieval trade route connecting Kraków with Częstochowa and further – with Greater Poland. A section of the cultural and pilgrimage trail Via Regia also runs here, which is one of the St. James' Ways leading to the sanctuary of this saint in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Czerwony Most\nid : 3598\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes, there is a designated trail for viewing outdoor sculptures in Nowa Huta. This trail was created in 2018 as part of a project supported by the European Year of Cultural Heritage.\n\nThe experience involves exploring various parts of Nowa Huta, including squares, parks, playgrounds, and lawns within housing estates, where these sculptures are scattered. These artworks were largely created in the 1960s and 1970s by young artists, many of whom were graduates of the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts. They were provided with housing, studios, and scholarships in exchange for their sculptures, which were intended to adorn the green spaces of the newly established city. The sculptures vary in artistic value and style, showcasing diverse techniques and materials.",
