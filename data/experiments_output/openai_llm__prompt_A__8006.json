Geographically, they are the eastern slopes of the Monastic Hill on the Kraków Bridge within the macroregion of the Kraków Gate. These hills are included in the area of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park.  \nFilarki are 20–30 m tall and have been undercut by the Vistula. They form the right boundary of its break known as the Tyniecka Gate. The left boundary is formed by the Piekarskie Rocks, and the width of the Vistula terrace in this area does not exceed 400 m.  \nFilarki are made of unweathered limestone from the upper Jurassic period without silica. They feature convex rock formations known as pillars and concave fissures which have widened due to karst phenomena, creating separate rock blocks. As a result of karst processes and erosion, the rocks have an uneven surface, rounded shapes, and numerous niches and recesses. They collect snail shells and remnants of small invertebrates.  \nAt the foot of Filarki, there are large rock blocks. Some lie directly at the base of the rocks, while others are a bit farther away, partially submerged in water. They were formed as a result of a landslide caused by an earthquake in 1786. There were so many fallen rocks that they had to be removed from the riverbed to maintain navigability.  \nIn the past, rock climbing was practiced at Filarki. Climbers have completed 16 climbing routes with difficulty levels ranging from V to VI.5+ in the Polish scale. Currently, climbing is prohibited.  \nFilarki contains two small cave shelters: Szczelina pod Klasztorem and Szczelina nad Wisłą.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : rock\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Bloki skalne po trzęsieniu ziemi 1786 rok.\nid : 2531\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : 06:00-22:00\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9414602 50.0705711, 19.9413012 50.0702886, 19.9411463 50.0699882, 19.9409165 50.0694854, 19.9407745 50.0692149, 19.9423529 50.0688382, 19.9424921 50.0688896, 19.9429163 50.0692906, 19.9430418 50.0694638, 19.9431033 50.0695714, 19.9429799 50.0695881, 19.9430134 50.0697322, 19.9430963 50.0697228, 19.9431461 50.0699451, 19.9426035 50.070061, 19.9424306 50.0697209, 19.9414407 50.0699549, 19.9418597 50.070728, 19.9418259 50.0707363, 19.9417996 50.070743, 19.9416835 50.0705208, 19.9415284 50.0705567, 19.9414602 50.0705711))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Park Jalu Kurka – a historic park located in the district I Stare Miasto in Krakow, at Kleparz on Szlak Street 71. It is named after Jalu Kurk, a Polish poet and prose writer, representative of the so-called Krakow Avant-Garde. \n\nThe park initially served as the garden of the Montelupich Palace, built in this place in the 15th century. It was common property until the property of the palace was taken over by the Tarnowski family. Stanisław Tarnowski, after remodeling the palace, transferred the palace garden to the city for public use by all residents. In 1948, the Congregation of the Salvatorians purchased the palace along with the park from the Tarnowskis. \n\nAfter World War II, the grounds of the palace and park were taken over by the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. The palace housed the headquarters of Radio Kraków, and the park was fully opened to the city's residents. \n\nAfter 1989, when a property commission for the Catholic Church was established, the congregation applied to the commission for the return of the palace and the adjacent park. The park was returned to the congregation, while the request for the return of the palace was withdrawn by the congregation when the Tarnowski family began efforts to declare the expropriation invalid. \n\nAfter the congregation regained the park, despite numerous protests from local residents, students from the nearby Krakow University of Technology, and councilors from District I, the park was closed. The congregation officially stated that the reason for the park's closure was the lack of funds for repairing the lighting and infrastructure of the park. \n\nIn 2008, the owners of the park applied for development conditions for part of the parkland, wishing to build the European Center for Salvatorian Formation on that site. They also informed that if they received permission for development, the remaining part of the park would be made available to the city's residents. However, the proposal for development was rejected by Jan Janczykowski, the provincial conservator of monuments. \n\nCurrently, an office building is being constructed on a part of the plot that is not protected, which previously served as the entrance to the park. \n\nSince 2017, the authorities of the city of Krakow have been in discussions with the Salvatorians regarding land exchange or the purchase of the park. Ultimately, in 2022, the Krakow municipality purchased the park area for the amount of 11 million PLN. The park was made available to residents on January 1, 2023. The park is open daily from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Park imienia Jalu Kurka\nid : 3477\n\nphone : +48 12 656 36 70\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://borek.ckpodgorza.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9044574 50.0004421, 19.9045191 50.0004311, 19.9045275 50.0004506, 19.9046954 50.0004207, 19.9047392 50.0005223, 19.9045096 50.0005632, 19.9041602 50.0006254, 19.9037671 50.0006954, 19.9035944 50.0007262, 19.9033695 50.0007662, 19.9033386 50.0006946, 19.9033042 50.0007007, 19.9032921 50.0006727, 19.9035009 50.0006355, 19.903496 50.0006241, 19.9035465 50.0006151, 19.9035422 50.000605, 19.9044574 50.0004421))\nhistoric : castle\nwiki_summary_en : Fort 52 \"Borek\" – one of the forts of the Kraków Fortress. It was built between 1885 and 1886, most likely designed by Daniel Salis-Soglio, and based on its model, three forts were constructed in the Przemyśl Fortress. Fort 52 \"Borek\" belonged to the VIII defensive sector of the Kraków Fortress, covering the areas between the valleys of the Wilga and the upper Vistula. It is a double-ring artillery fort. The higher rampart was intended for artillery, while the lower one was for infantry and light guns. The caponiers were equipped with machine guns and later with automatic rifles. The fort features the first three-level underground intersection in Kraków for the movement of soldiers and transportation of armaments.  \nThe fort's task was to guard the exits of main roads and to defend the Vienna route (now known as Zakopianka) and approaches to the fortress ring from the direction of Libertów. The fort did not participate in the battles of World War I.  \nDuring World War II, Russian and French prisoners were held in the fort. On December 26, 1944, an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was forced to land with its landing gear retracted in front of the fort. It had been damaged during a raid on the refinery in Blechhammer (now: Blachownia, part of Kędzierzyn-Koźle), and its crew attempted to reach areas controlled by the Red Army. Until the 1990s, there was a vehicle and equipment base of a construction cooperative located here. For several years, it remained unused and was in poor technical condition. From 2013 to 2022, the fort underwent revitalization, and since July 30, 2022, it has been managed by the Podgórze Cultural Center and is the seat of the Polish Song Library. In the place where the American bomber landed in 1944, trees grew after the war. In June 2022, the area was developed and made available to residents as a park.  \nFort 52 Borek is located between Korpala, Władysław Krygowski, and Forteczna streets in Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : arts_centre\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Forteczna\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : info@ckpodgorza.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Centrum Kultury Podgórza - Fort Borek;fort Borek\nid : 3582\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9691133 50.0896745, 19.9691127 50.0897283, 19.9691127 50.0897472, 19.969115 50.0898137, 19.9691114 50.0898157, 19.9691124 50.0898249, 19.9691153 50.0898278, 19.9691182 50.089913, 19.9691217 50.0899164, 19.9691216 50.0899266, 19.9691174 50.089929, 19.9691192 50.0899899, 19.96912 50.0900432, 19.9691207 50.090085, 19.9682813 50.0901076, 19.9682709 50.0901085, 19.9682568 50.0901097, 19.9677768 50.0901231, 19.9677921 50.0902883, 19.967842 50.090544, 19.9679016 50.0906757, 19.9679196 50.0907005, 19.9679437 50.0907259, 19.9679753 50.0907487, 19.9680148 50.090765, 19.9680595 50.0907752, 19.9681024 50.0907738, 19.9681551 50.0907653, 19.9682782 50.090728, 19.9683204 50.0907191, 19.9684999 50.090734, 19.968759 50.0907067, 19.9689028 50.0907284, 19.9690799 50.0907007, 19.9691329 50.0907078, 19.9692129 50.0907437, 19.9692704 50.0907659, 19.9693279 50.0907804, 19.9693872 50.0907811, 19.9697909 50.0908303, 19.9698257 50.0908325, 19.9698751 50.0908302, 19.9698599 50.0907117, 19.9697968 50.0902197, 19.9697618 50.0899339, 19.9697583 50.0899043, 19.9697699 50.0899039, 19.969755 50.0896653, 19.9697466 50.0896656, 19.9691133 50.0896745))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Ogród nad Sudołem – a city park in Krakow, located in District III Prądnik Czerwony, in the Prądnik Czerwony housing estate, between Naczelna Street to the west and the Sudół Dominikański stream to the north.
