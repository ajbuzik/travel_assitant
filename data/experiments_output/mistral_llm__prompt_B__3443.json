The first proposal to erect a monument was put forward immediately after Stanisław Wyspiański's death; 20 years later, it ended with the establishment of a monument construction committee, and on the 50th anniversary of his death, the matter arose once again. In 1977, the President of Kraków, Jerzy Pękala, made another attempt to erect a monument to Wyspiański, with approval from the Ministry of Culture, and the initial funding for this purpose came from leftover funds from the construction of the Grunwald Monument. In January 1978, the first proposal for the monument's location was made for the St. Ducha Square next to the Słowacki Theatre, followed by another at Szczepański Square and the last one at the New Building of the National Museum. The first competition in February 1978 received 77 entries, and then another competition was announced, but ultimately, the project that was sent for realization was the one that did not participate in the competition, authored by Marian Konieczny, who was also a member of the monument’s construction committee and the competition jury. On November 28, 1982, on the 75th anniversary of Wyspiański's death, the monument was solemnly unveiled. On the 1-meter high granite pedestal of the monument, as if frozen in a choral dance, a group of bronze figures from Wyspiański's dramas forms a procession: Jaś, the Jew, Chochoł, Stańczyk, and Isia from \"Wesele,\" the Old Veteran from \"Warszawianka,\" and Pallas Athena from \"Noc Listopadowa\" surrounding the column on which Stanisław Wyspiański stands, deep in thought, in a characteristic Young Poland cloak. The casting of the monument was carried out by Gliwickie Zakłady Urządzeń Technicznych.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Stanisław Wyspiański;Marian Konieczny\nid : 2452\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9502051 50.0662913)\nhistoric : memorial\nwiki_summary_en : The Ignacy Jan Paderewski Monument in Strzelecki Park - a monument commemorating Ignacy Jan Paderewski, located in Krakow, in the Grzegórzki district in Strzelecki Park, at 16 Lubicz Street, in Wesoła.

It was established in 1900 at the initiative of Professor Walery Jaworski by a resolution of the Medical Faculty of UJ on April 27. The collections were largely sourced from donations from doctors and professors affiliated with UJ, such as Edward Korczyński, Adam Wrzosek (library), Józef Bogusz (library, collection of tools and instruments), as well as their families, including Ludwik Bierkowski, Tytus Chałubiński, and Adam Bochenek. Jaworski himself also donated his private collections to the museum. After the first year of operation, the museum had 1,222 items (1,769 exhibits), and by 1905 – 4,617.\n\nIn 1920, the Department of the History and Philosophy of Medicine was established, directed by Professor Władysław Szumowski, who focused on the systematization and display of the already significant collections. Converted into a Chair, it did not, however, have a permanent location, and the premises obtained in 1937 for the Chair and Museum on M. Kopernika Street 7 were unsuitable for setting up an exhibition. The secured collections there survived the occupation in an undamaged state. Between 1951 and 1956, the Chair was transformed into the Department of Health Organization, which saved the collections during a time when all departments of the history of medicine were being dissolved. The re-establishment of the Chair did not solve the space problem – it was not until 1990 that premises in the House of the Medical Society at 4 Radziwiłłowska Street were allocated for the Museum. The new headquarters were officially opened on June 16, 1992, by the then rector of CM UJ, Professor Andrzej Szczeklik. \n\nThe museum's collections include, among other things, incunabula, documents, manuscripts, commemorative medals, medical instruments, and portraits. An important part of the collection is a large set of surgical instruments and a collection of plaster casts from Professor Bierkowski's anatomic-pathological office, as well as a collection of the history of diseases from the clinic of Professor Maciej Józef Brodowicz. \n\nVisiting the museum is possible by prior arrangement of the date.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : mburbani@cyf-kr.edu.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Anatomii;Museum of Anatomy;Muzeum Katedry Anatomii Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego Collegium Medicum;Orvoslástörténeti Múzeum\nid : 2845\n\nphone : +48 12 4100770\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Tu-Su 11:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://www.muzeum-ak.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9491122 50.0724855, 19.9487021 50.0721103, 19.9485364 50.0721859, 19.9485161 50.0721681, 19.9484828 50.0721826, 19.948452 50.0721976, 19.9484705 50.0722157, 19.948302 50.0722917, 19.9487129 50.072667, 19.9491122 50.0724855), (19.9487021 50.0722809, 19.9488988 50.0724612, 19.9487439 50.0725302, 19.9485498 50.0723497, 19.9487021 50.0722809))\nhistoric : yes\nwiki_summary_en : The Home Army Museum (Polish: Muzeum Armii Krajowej) was created in Kraków, Poland in 2000, to commemorate the struggle for independence by the underground Polish Secret State and its military arm, the Hope Army, the largest resistance movement in occupied Europe during World War II. The museum is named after general Emil August Fieldorf \"Nil\". It is the only such institution in Poland promoting knowledge about the Polish Underground State and its armed forces during World War II. The idea behind the Home Army Museum is to provide a holistic picture of the Polish underground, its spiritual origins and the shape of patriotic heritage to the present day.\nThe museum was established in 2000 as a local self-government unit but the formal establishment was preceded by a ten-year effort of collecting the historical items of the Home Army Veterans. So far, the museum has collected more than 8,000 exhibits and more than 12,000 archives – mostly gifts of Army Soldiers and their families around the world – historical memorabilia, often with the tenor of relics. The library resources reach about 11,500 volumes.\n\nThe permanent exhibition presents the history of Polish Underground State and Home Army in their complexity. The main section of the exhibition begins with the so-called September Campaign (Invasion of Poland, 1939). The division of Poland into two occupied zones, German and Soviet, consists of several sections (pe. Society, Terror, concentration camps, Holocaust and attitude of the Underground State towards persecuted Jews, etc.) and are well documented with photographic displays. Day-by-day life, both civilian and military, and the policy of both occupants is shown in the rich narrative scenography of the exhibition, based on documents and artefacts such as uniforms, munitions, many documents and decorations.\nThe main part of the exhibition is situated in the basement. Visitors are confronted with hundreds of photos and memorabilia telling stories of selected Home Army members. One of the most precious exhibits is the diary of a famous major \"Hubal\" – Henryk Dobrzański, the first guerilla commander of the World War II in Europe. Among other artefacts there is a replica of a fuselage section of Halifax (British heavy bomber) and a reconstructed inner structure of a V-2 rocket. The reconstruction of a detention cell in which after 1944 Polish Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Department of Security) held members of the Home Army and postwar Freedom and Independence organisation gives the opportunity to experience the communist terror. The museum has an extensive weapon collection, including homemade projectiles.\nThe museum is located at Ulica Wita Stwosza 12, in the Grzegórzki District of Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Wita Stwosza\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Armii Krajowej;Muzeum Armii Krajowej im.

His intention was to receive a blessing prior to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. For the next two centuries the meadow belonged to nuns, who in 1366 exchanged it with the city's authorities for a manor at Florianska Street. The meadow was used by peasants from neighboring villages to graze their cattle.\nUntil the 19th century Błonia Park was largely neglected, and often flooded by the Rudawa river in the spring turning it into wetland with small islands, probably contributing to the spread of epidemics. After draining the swamps, Błonia became perfectly suitable to host large gatherings. In 1809, when the city was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw, Błonia was a place of salute of the troops of Napoleon, organized by Prince Jozef Poniatowski and General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski.  \nToday Błonia is a recreation area, frequently hosting large events like concerts and exhibitions. The place is best known for great Masses celebrated by Pope John Paul II in 1979, 1983, 1987, 1997 and 2002. Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated the Mass there during his journey to Poland in May 2006. The opening Mass of the 2016 World Youth Day was held at Błonia Park in July 2016, however the main events, including the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis, were held outside the city.\nBłonia Park is also used to host popular culture events, such as concerts organized by a local radio station or the Iuvenalia student festival. Pop star Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour concert on June 28, 2008 performed to nearly 55,000 people  The vast meadow was also used for politicized promotion of the Małopolska region farming industry by PSL in 2011 with a herd of 150 sheep trucked in from hundreds of kilometres away for one month, and the city permit worth 3,200 złoty.

Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz). Some of its monumental polychrome murals were designed by Poland's leading history painter, Jan Matejko (1838–1893). In 1978, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nOn every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, a trumpet signal—called the Hejnał mariacki—is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary's two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th-century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by Polish Radio Jedynka.\nSaint Mary's Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint Michael's and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral style.\nThe church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1928 book The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Kościół pw.

Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Królowej Jadwigi\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Dom Zwierzyniecki;Zwierzyniec House;Zwierzyniec Ház\nid : 3613\n\n",
  "answer": "The **Hejnał mariacki** (St. Mary’s Trumpet Call) is one of Kraków’s most iconic traditions, deeply rooted in the city’s history and culture. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its significance and origins:\n\n---\n\n### **What is the Hejnał mariacki?**\n- A **five-note trumpet melody** played **every hour, 24/7**, from the taller tower of **St. Mary’s Basilica (Kościół Mariacki)** in Kraków’s Main Market Square.\n- The tune is **abruptly cut short**—a poignant reminder of a legendary 13th-century trumpeter who was **shot in the throat** while warning the city of an impending **Mongol (Tatar) invasion**.\n- The **noon hejnał** (played at 12:00 PM) is broadcast live by **Polish Radio 1 (Jedynka)** and serves as a symbolic \"heartbeat\" of Kraków, heard nationwide.\n\n---\n\n### **Historical Significance**\n1. **Legend of the Trumpeter (1241)**\n   - During the **Mongol siege of Kraków**, a watchman in St. Mary’s tower spotted invaders approaching. He began playing the hejnał to alert the city but was **struck by an arrow in the throat**, cutting the melody short.\n   - The city’s gates were closed in time, saving Kraków from destruction. The truncated hejnał became a **symbol of resilience and sacrifice**.\n\n2. **Medieval Origins**\n   - The hejnał tradition dates back to the **14th century**, when Kraków’s tower watchmen used trumpets to signal:\n     - The **opening/closing of city gates** (dawn/dusk).\n     - **Fires, attacks, or other dangers**.\n   - Over time, it evolved into a **ceremonial signal**, marking the hours and honoring Kraków’s history.\n\n3. **Modern Symbolism**\n   - Today, the hejnał is a **UNESCO-listed intangible cultural heritage** element (as part of Kraków’s Old Town).\n   - It represents:\n     - **Civic pride** (Kraków’s resistance to invaders).\n     - **Continuity** (played without interruption for centuries, even during WWII).\n     - **Unity** (the noon hejnał unites Poles nationwide).\n\n---\n\n### **Cultural Impact**\n- **Literature & Media**:\n  - Inspired Eric P. Kelly’s 1928 novel *The Trumpeter of Krakow*, which popularized the legend globally.\n  - Featured in films, music, and art as a symbol of Polish heritage.\n- **Tourist Tradition**:\n  - Visitors gather in the **Main Market Square** at noon to hear the live broadcast and watch the trumpeter (a **Kraków fireman** in traditional uniform) play from the tower.\n  - The **Kraków Fire Brigade** has maintained the tradition since 1927, with trumpeters performing in **historical costumes**.\n- **Musical Variations**:\n  - The hejnał has been adapted into **orchestral works, folk songs, and even electronic music**, but the original melody remains sacred.\n\n---\n\n### **Where to Experience It**\n1. **St. Mary’s Basilica (Bazylika Mariacka)**\n   - **Location**: Plac Mariacki 5, Kraków (northeast corner of the Main Square).\n   - **Best Time**: **Noon** (for the live radio broadcast) or any hour to hear it in person.\n   - **Tip**: Climb the **tower** (70 m high, 239 steps) for a panoramic view of Kraków (entry fee ~15 PLN).\n\n2. **Main Market Square (Rynek Główny)**\n   - Stand near the **Cloth Hall (Sukiennice)** or **Town Hall Tower** for the clearest sound.\n\n3. **Virtual Experience**:\n   - Listen to the **live noon hejnał** on [Polish Radio 1](https://www.polskieradio.pl/1) or YouTube.\n\n---\n\n### **Fun Facts**\n- The hejnał is played **exactly 144 times a day** (once every hour, including midnight).\n- During **WWII**, the Nazis **banned** the hejnał, but Krakowians secretly played it on underground radio. It resumed publicly in 1945.\n- The **trumpet used today** is a replica of a 16th-century instrument.\n- The melody is **copyright-free** and often used in Polish ceremonies (e.g., national holidays).\n\n---\n### **Why It Matters**\nThe Hejnał mariacki is more than a tourist attraction—it’s a **living piece of Kraków’s soul**, connecting past and present. Whether you hear it while sipping coffee in the square or climbing the basilica’s tower, it’s a must-experience tradition that embodies the city’s **spirit of defiance and beauty**.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Pair your visit with a tour of **St. Mary’s Basilica** (home to Veit Stoss’s famous altarpiece) or a stop at **Café Szalona** nearby for a view of the tower.",
