Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl] ; Zamek Królewski na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe.

The palace was established in 1540 when two neighboring Gothic tenements from the 14th century were combined and rebuilt into a magnate residence. The owners of the new palace at that time were the Firlej family. In the 17th century, when the property was in the possession of the Zbaraskis, a comprehensive reconstruction was carried out to give the building the fashionable stylistic features of the time and to transform it into a representative urban residence of the magnate family. The construction works were supervised by the Flemish architect Henryk van Peene, who was brought to Poland by Jerzy Zbaraski. A baroque, two-story, arcaded courtyard with cloisters and an entrance hall from the side of the Main Market Square was created then. \n\nAnother reconstruction of the residence took place in the years 1778–1783 and was carried out at the request of the then owner, Count Eliasz Wodzicki. Architect Ferdynand Nax gave the palace features of the early classicist style. In the following decades, its owners changed frequently. Among those who lived there were the Potulicki family of the Grzymała coat of arms, the Rostworowski family of the Nałęcz coat of arms, the Wiśniowiecki family of the Korybut coat of arms, the Jabłonowski family of the Prus III coat of arms, and the Radziwiłł family of the Trąby coat of arms. By the end of the 19th century, the building became the property of the Potocki family of the Pilawa coat of arms. At their request, from 1896 to 1898, the residence was restored, transforming the interiors of the ground floor rooms and partially rebuilding the internal courtyard. The architect Karol Zaremba was the author of these changes. \n\nFurther works were carried out in the palace in the years 1910–1912. The designers were architects Ludwik Wojtyczko and Kazimierz Wyczyński. New staircases were installed, and the interiors of the second residential floor were reconstructed. The first floor retained its representative character, emphasized by decorative elements of the salons. After World War II, the palace was renovated and reconstructed. To this day, Corinthian pilasters in the facades, a stone portal, and rich sculptural decoration crowning the top of the building (including coat-of-arms cartouches) have survived. \n\nIt housed the Goethe Institute.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pałac Zbaraskich\nid : 3364\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : We-Su 10:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://muzeumkrakowa.pl/oddzialy/celestat\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9492882 50.0655476, 19.9492467 50.0654183, 19.9492225 50.0653183, 19.9492281 50.0652351, 19.9493732 50.0652179, 19.9493899 50.0652768, 19.9494024 50.065323, 19.9494243 50.0654007, 19.9494206 50.0654012, 19.9494535 50.0655198, 19.9494575 50.0655191, 19.9494765 50.0655601, 19.9494787 50.0655598, 19.9495017 50.0656084, 19.9494997 50.0656089, 19.9495184 50.0656502, 19.9493486 50.0656789, 19.9492882 50.0655476))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Celestat (from German Zielstätte) – the place for exercises of the Krakow shooting brotherhood.

Together with the Sandomierska tower, it forms a unique group of so-called fire towers.\n\nIt was probably erected between 1447 and 1460 during the reign of Casimir Jagiellonian to strengthen the castle's defenses after the spread of new types of artillery. The lower floors are made of stone, while the upper ones are made of brick. Vertical communication was provided by stairs located within the thickness of the wall. Shortly after its construction, a decision was made to raise the tower by covering it with a high steep roof. Around 1517, a new arrow slit was cut into the wall of the ground floor. In 1534, the tower was connected to the southern wing of the royal palace, and the lower floors were remodeled, among other purposes, to accommodate a chamber for the \"young king,\" i.e., Sigismund Augustus. According to Bielski's Chronicle, in 1595, the highest floor above the corbels was lowered \"due to the great weight it had.\" At that time, a finish with panel divides and round windows was created. Its oldest name, Lubranka, comes from the name of the castle's attorney general, Grzegorz from Lubraniec. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was also called Olbramka, Wolbromka, and Skarbowa. Ultimately, the name Senatorska Tower was adopted. In October 1536, a fire destroyed the tower, which was renovated between 1540 and 1543. In 1584, near the tower, Samuel Zborowski was executed.\n\nThe tower has been repeatedly damaged by fires, including in 1656 during the Swedish occupation, and renovated. Around 1858, it was remodeled (like other Wawel towers) by the Austrians, with the removal of the sloping roof and the introduction of a pseudo-Gothic crenellation. Further unfavorable modifications occurred during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1943, when the latrine bay was removed, a window was cut into the ground floor, the vault in the basement was removed, and a fireplace was placed where the historical entrance used to be. Around 1965, the damaged pseudo-Gothic crenellation from the partitioning times was replaced. The repeatedly proposed restoration of the historical shape of the tower with the roof covering was realized only in 2002-2003 according to the design of architect Piotr Stępień in cooperation with Dr. engineer Stanisław Karczmarczyk. The roof was covered with monk-nun tiles, and the latrine bay destroyed by the German occupiers was reconstructed. These works were combined with the conservation of the entire wall of the tower.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Baszta Senatorska;Senatorerturm;Сенаторская башня;Szenátori-torony\nid : 3501\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : http://dommonarukrakow.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((20.107738 50.06775, 20.107758 50.06771, 20.1077719 50.0676842, 20.107786 50.067658, 20.107808 50.06762, 20.107924 50.067645, 20.107919 50.067655, 20.107943 50.06766, 20.107949 50.067647, 20.107978 50.067639, 20.10801 50.067647, 20.108025 50.067664, 20.108018 50.067677, 20.108046 50.067683, 20.108043 50.067688, 20.108161 50.067714, 20.108159 50.067719, 20.10823 50.067735, 20.108174 50.067841, 20.108101 50.067825, 20.1081 50.067827, 20.107983 50.067801, 20.10798 50.067806, 20.107848 50.067777, 20.10785 50.067774, 20.107738 50.06775))\nhistoric : castle\nwiki_summary_en : The Kirchmayer Palace is a historic building, part of the farmstead complex located in Krakow, in the XVIII district of Nowa Huta at 4 Suchy Jar Street, in Pleszów.
