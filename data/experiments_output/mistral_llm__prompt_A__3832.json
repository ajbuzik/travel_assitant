It is named after Jalu Kurk, a Polish poet and prose writer, representative of the so-called Krakow Avant-Garde. \n\nThe park initially served as the garden of the Montelupich Palace, built in this place in the 15th century. It was common property until the property of the palace was taken over by the Tarnowski family. Stanisław Tarnowski, after remodeling the palace, transferred the palace garden to the city for public use by all residents. In 1948, the Congregation of the Salvatorians purchased the palace along with the park from the Tarnowskis. \n\nAfter World War II, the grounds of the palace and park were taken over by the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. The palace housed the headquarters of Radio Kraków, and the park was fully opened to the city's residents. \n\nAfter 1989, when a property commission for the Catholic Church was established, the congregation applied to the commission for the return of the palace and the adjacent park. The park was returned to the congregation, while the request for the return of the palace was withdrawn by the congregation when the Tarnowski family began efforts to declare the expropriation invalid. \n\nAfter the congregation regained the park, despite numerous protests from local residents, students from the nearby Krakow University of Technology, and councilors from District I, the park was closed. The congregation officially stated that the reason for the park's closure was the lack of funds for repairing the lighting and infrastructure of the park. \n\nIn 2008, the owners of the park applied for development conditions for part of the parkland, wishing to build the European Center for Salvatorian Formation on that site. They also informed that if they received permission for development, the remaining part of the park would be made available to the city's residents. However, the proposal for development was rejected by Jan Janczykowski, the provincial conservator of monuments. \n\nCurrently, an office building is being constructed on a part of the plot that is not protected, which previously served as the entrance to the park. \n\nSince 2017, the authorities of the city of Krakow have been in discussions with the Salvatorians regarding land exchange or the purchase of the park. Ultimately, in 2022, the Krakow municipality purchased the park area for the amount of 11 million PLN. The park was made available to residents on January 1, 2023. The park is open daily from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Park imienia Jalu Kurka\nid : 3477\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : LINESTRING (19.9099889 50.1142366, 19.9101438 50.1142556, 19.9102534 50.114259)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Czerwony Most – a historic structure, one of the objects of the Austrian Fortress of Kraków. A grade-separated intersection of the axial road (Waliszewskiego Street) and the access road to the Pękowice fort (Pękowicka Street), preventing congestion that could arise during combat when troops were simultaneously regrouping along both roads. This could have had very serious consequences, which is why about 100 years ago, a two-level intersection was built on the then far outskirts of the city. Recently, renovation work restored Czerwony Most to its original appearance.  \nBeneath Czerwony Most runs the Eagle's Nests Trail, which coincides with the former medieval trade route connecting Kraków with Częstochowa and further – with Greater Poland.

It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Fort 44 \"Tonie\"\nid : 3693\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9471491 49.9940478, 19.9471437 49.9940447, 19.947135 49.9939979, 19.9471406 49.9939921, 19.9473299 49.9939748, 19.9473426 49.9940323, 19.9471491 49.9940478))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : The ammunition shelter \"Swoszowice\" was built between 1913 and 1914 according to a typical design developed before 1913.

  "answer": "Based on the provided context, here’s the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding **Fort 49a \"Dłubnia\"** in Kraków:\n\n### **Current Condition & Accessibility**\n1. **Historical Context**:\n   - Built between **1892–1896** as part of the **Kraków Fortress** to defend the **Dłubnia Valley**, in cooperation with nearby forts (49 Krzesławice, 48a Mistrzejowice).\n   - **Not involved in WWI battles** but was under military control during the interwar period.\n   - **Armored towers were blown up during WWII** (likely by retreating German forces or Soviet advances).\n   - Post-WWII, it served as a **warehouse until 1990**.\n\n2. **Current Status**:\n   - The context does **not** provide explicit details on recent renovations, public access, or guided tours.\n   - Unlike **Fort 44 \"Tonie\"** (which is actively managed by the *Open Fortress* foundation) or **Fort 50½ \"Kosocice\"** (part of the Kraków Fortress Museum), **Fort 49a lacks clear institutional oversight** for tourism.\n   - **No opening hours, contact details, or official website** are listed, suggesting it is **not regularly open to the public** as a formal attraction.\n\n3. **Physical Accessibility**:\n   - Located at **S. Petőfiego Street** in Kraków (coordinates: `19.8958066, 50.1235526`).\n   - The **geometry data** shows it’s a sizable structure, but there’s **no information on wheelchair access, parking, or visitor amenities**.\n   - The fort’s **armored towers are destroyed**, but the main structure likely remains intact (similar to other Kraków forts).\n\n4. **Potential for Visits**:\n   - **Unofficial Access**: Like many abandoned forts, it may be **physically accessible** (e.g., no fences/gates), but entering could pose **safety risks** (unstable structures, no lighting).\n   - **Local Exploration**: Some urban explorers or history enthusiasts visit such sites, but **no organized tours** are mentioned.\n   - **Nearby Points of Interest**:\n     - **Fort 44 \"Tonie\"** (15 min drive; open for guided tours via *Janus Foundation*).\n     - **Kraków Fortress Museum** (manages some forts; check for updates on Fort 49a).\n\n5. **Recommendations**:\n   - **Contact Local Groups**: Reach out to:\n     - **Fundacja Janus** ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FundacjaJanus/)) – Manages Fort 44 and may have insights.\n     - **Kraków Fortress Museum** (official site: [muzeum.krakow.pl](https://muzeum.krakow.pl)) – Ask about occasional access.\n   - **Safety First**: If visiting independently, **avoid unstable areas**, respect private property, and check for local restrictions.\n   - **Alternatives**: For a guaranteed fort experience, visit:\n     - **Fort 44 \"Tonie\"** (modernized, guided tours).\n     - **Fort 50½ \"Kosocice\"** (part of the museum, occasionally open).\n\n### **Summary**\nFort 49a \"Dłubnia\" is **not an active tourist site** based on available data. While its ruins exist, there’s **no official access program**, and its condition may be hazardous. For a safer, curated experience, prioritize other forts in the Kraków Fortress system.\n\nWould you like help finding guided tours for nearby forts or historical context on the Dłubnia Valley’s defenses?",
