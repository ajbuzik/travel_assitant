The structure was built between 1898 and 1901. The Art Nouveau building was designed by architect Franciszek Mączyński, inspired by the famous exhibition pavilion of the Secession in Vienna. The decoration of the Palace of Art involved the most distinguished artists from Krakow. The striking frieze, depicting the changing fortunes of an artist, was designed by Jacek Malczewski. Antoni Madeyski, Konstanty Laszczka, and Teodor Rygier created busts of masters particularly significant for Polish art. The façade of the palace is adorned with a colonnade, topped with a statue of Apollo in a sunny halo. The building's roof is made of metal, partially glazed. From Szczepański Square, there is a bust of Jan Matejko sculpted by Antoni Madeyski, mirrored on the Plant side by a bust of Stanisław Wyspiański sculpted by Anna Reynoch. The walls are decorated with pilasters, flattened window arches, and above all, the entrance portico with two columns. The building functions as an art gallery. At the initiative of the members of the Society of Friends of Fine Arts and representatives of the Rotary Club, presentations of contemporary Polish art as well as exhibitions of foreign artists take place there. The building also hosts auctions of works of art.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Plac Szczepański\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pałac Sztuki;Palace of Art;Палац мистецтв;Palast der Kunst;Művészetek Palotája\nid : 3464\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://www.mocak.pl\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9616191 50.0480868, 19.9616764 50.0482451, 19.9617155 50.0482382, 19.9617624 50.0482299, 19.9617493 50.0481808, 19.9619638 50.0481455, 19.9617716 50.0476026, 19.9616755 50.0476176, 19.9615794 50.0476325, 19.961558 50.0475835, 19.9609881 50.047667, 19.9608643 50.0473133, 19.9604605 50.0473742, 19.9604734 50.0474113, 19.96075 50.0473677, 19.9608041 50.0475283, 19.9607481 50.0475362, 19.9609582 50.0481299, 19.9610586 50.0481136, 19.9610708 50.0481414, 19.9611467 50.0481293, 19.9611551 50.0481555, 19.9612436 50.0481416, 19.9612538 50.0481644, 19.9615052 50.0481269, 19.9614952 50.0481047, 19.9616191 50.0480868))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Museum of Contemporary Art in Kraków (MOCAK), (Polish: Muzeum Sztuki Współczesnej w Krakowie), is a contemporary art gallery in Kraków, Poland that opened on 19 May 2011.

Królewski na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 17th most visited art museum in the world.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Zamek Wawel;Wawel;Wawelburg;Kasteel van Wawel\nid : 4019\n\nphone : +48 12 433 58 40\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Tu-Sa 10:00-18:00; Su 10:00-16:00\nwebsite : https://mnk.pl/oddzial/muzeum-im-emeryka-hutten-czapskiego\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9297406 50.0600552, 19.9298659 50.0596622, 19.9299602 50.0596653, 19.9305934 50.0596833, 19.9305269 50.0599057, 19.9305082 50.0599681, 19.9305119 50.0599686, 19.9304908 50.0600111, 19.9304812 50.0600098, 19.9304603 50.0600752, 19.9304347 50.0601556, 19.9304034 50.0601504, 19.9303721 50.0601451, 19.9297999 50.0600636, 19.9297406 50.0600552))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Emeryk Hutten-Czapski Museum (Polish: Muzeum im. Emeryka Hutten-Czapskiego), also known as the Czapski Museum (Polish: Muzeum Czapskich) is a branch of the National Museum of Kraków, 12 Pilsudski Street, Kraków.\nCount Emeryk Hutten-Czapski (born 17 October 1828 in Stankow near Minsk, died 23 July 1896 in Kraków) was a Vice-Governor of St Petersburg and an important collector of books, prints, and numismatics. He built his collection at his family estate in Stankow, today in Belarus. Fearing for the safety of the collection, being close to Russia, he moved the collection to Cracow. In 1894, he purchased a 19th-century palace, on what is today 12 Pilsudski Street, and built an addition to house his collection. He personally catalogued the collection. He died in 1896, before the addition was finished. His wife, Baroness Elzbieta Meyendorff, completed the construction of the addition, and in 1904, as per her husband's request, donated the collection to the city of Cracow. The museum displays the Czapski crest on the outside, along with the inscription on the pediment: \"Monumentis Patriae Naufragio Ereptis\" (Patriotic Monuments Saved from the Destruction of the Storm).\nThe collection originally contained more than 11,000 coins, medals, orders, prints and books. Upon the death of Bogdan Hutten-Czapski, a nephew of Emeryks, his large collection of books and prints was added to the museum library. The museum continually received generous donations from other coin collectors. Important donations came from Wiktor Wittyg, Zygmunt Zakrzewski, Franciszek Piekosinski, Karol Halama, Piotr Uminski and Konstanty Schmidt-Ciążyński, among others. At the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, the collection was stored in barrels. The museum was reopened in 1917 and once again at the outset of World War II, in 1939, was closed and the collection was again safeguarded.  Since 1939 the museum remained closed to the public. With funding from the European Regional Development Fund of the European Economic Community the project of the European Centre of Numismatics in Cracow could be completed, and the restored museum and gardens were opened once again to the public in 2013. The museum has been renovated to a world class museum with touch screens throughout, explaining the different exhibits in Polish and English.\nIn April 2016, on the gardens of the museum, a pavilion was erected to commemorate Emeryk's grandson, Józef Czapski. Jozef was an eminent Polish intellectual, writer, painter and critic. The modern pavilion displays Czapski's diaries, paintings, and contains various multimedia presentations. The layout of the Pavilion's permanent exhibition was designed by Krystyna Zachwatowicz and her husband, the film director Andrzej Wajda.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : czapscy@mnk.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum im.

The initial collection was formed in 1796 in Puławy by Princess Izabela Czartoryska. The Museum officially opened in 1878. It is now a division of the National Museum in Kraków.\nThe Puławy collection was partly destroyed after the November 1830 Uprising and the confiscation of the Czartoryski properties. Most of the Museum holdings, however, were saved and moved to Paris, where they reposed at the Hôtel Lambert. In 1870 Prince Władysław Czartoryski decided to move the collections to Kraków, where they arrived in 1876.\nThe most renowned painting at the Museum is one of Leonardo da Vinci's best-known works, the Lady with an Ermine. Other highlights include two works by Rembrandt; several antiquities, including sculptures; Renaissance tapestries and decorative arts; and paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger, Jacob Jordaens, Luca Giordano, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Dieric Bouts, Joos van Cleve, Lorenzo Lotto, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Lorenzo Monaco, Andrea Mantegna, Alessandro Magnasco, and the Master of the Female Half-Lengths.\nThe Museum's main facility closed for restoration in 2010 and reopened in December 2019. During this time, parts of the collection were displayed at other venues.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : yes\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Książąt Czartoryskich w Krakowie;Czartoryscy\nid : 6175\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9361073 50.0547467)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Wawel Royal Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl] ; Zamek Królewski na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 17th most visited art museum in the world.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Wawel;Vavel\nid : 11464\n\n",
