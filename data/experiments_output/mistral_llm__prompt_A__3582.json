The place took its name from the surname of Unterscharführer Albert Hujar (also Huyar) who committed and directed the executions. It is also a mockery of Hujar's surname, which is pronounced similarly to a vulgar Polish language expression for \"penis\" (its English equivalent is \"prick\"), hence the name is Polish for \"Prick Hill\", because it could be seen from almost any part of the camp. Before World War II, an old Austrian fortification of the 19th century, dismantled in the 1930s, had been located on a hill. After destroying the fort, a large hexagonal pit remained here, with a circumference of up to 50 meters and a depth of up to 5 meters. \nStarting from August-September 1943, ”Chujowa Gorka” had become the main place of mass executions of prisoners in Plaszow and was used until mid-February 1944, when it was filled with bodies. The prisoners were usually marched to a ditch surrounding Hujowa Gorka and told to lie down. An SS man, a Genickschußspezialist (specialist in shooting in the neck), would then administer a Nackenschuß, a shot in the nape of the neck. A dental technician, usually a Jew, would then pull the gold teeth out of each victim’s mouth. The dead bodies were then covered with a layer of dirt, though once Płaszow became a concentration camp the bodies were burned. The victims’ clothes were sent to the camp’s storehouses and most of the valuables were taken by the executioners. In 1944 the Germans leveled the site and even built some barracks above the mass grave. Immediately after the war, a large wooden cross with barbed wire was erected at the site to commemorate the Christian Poles who died in Płaszów.\nAlbert Hujar was the German officer who offered the place for the mass execution of Jews who arrived from the town of Bochnia (east of Krakow) in the summer of 1943. Albert Hujar, who served in the Schutzstaffel (SS) Concentration Camp service, is portrayed in the 1993 drama Schindler's List by Norbert Weisser.\n\n\n== References ==\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Chujowa Górka\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Hujowa Górka;Chujowa Górka;Хуёва-Гурка\nid : 2434\n\nphone : +48 12 4100770\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Tu-Su 11:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://www.muzeum-ak.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9491122 50.0724855, 19.9487021 50.0721103, 19.9485364 50.0721859, 19.9485161 50.0721681, 19.9484828 50.0721826, 19.948452 50.0721976, 19.9484705 50.0722157, 19.948302 50.0722917, 19.9487129 50.072667, 19.9491122 50.0724855), (19.9487021 50.0722809, 19.9488988 50.0724612, 19.9487439 50.0725302, 19.9485498 50.0723497, 19.9487021 50.0722809))\nhistoric : yes\nwiki_summary_en : The Home Army Museum (Polish: Muzeum Armii Krajowej) was created in Kraków, Poland in 2000, to commemorate the struggle for independence by the underground Polish Secret State and its military arm, the Hope Army, the largest resistance movement in occupied Europe during World War II. The museum is named after general Emil August Fieldorf \"Nil\". It is the only such institution in Poland promoting knowledge about the Polish Underground State and its armed forces during World War II. The idea behind the Home Army Museum is to provide a holistic picture of the Polish underground, its spiritual origins and the shape of patriotic heritage to the present day.\nThe museum was established in 2000 as a local self-government unit but the formal establishment was preceded by a ten-year effort of collecting the historical items of the Home Army Veterans. So far, the museum has collected more than 8,000 exhibits and more than 12,000 archives – mostly gifts of Army Soldiers and their families around the world – historical memorabilia, often with the tenor of relics. The library resources reach about 11,500 volumes.\n\nThe permanent exhibition presents the history of Polish Underground State and Home Army in their complexity. The main section of the exhibition begins with the so-called September Campaign (Invasion of Poland, 1939). The division of Poland into two occupied zones, German and Soviet, consists of several sections (pe. Society, Terror, concentration camps, Holocaust and attitude of the Underground State towards persecuted Jews, etc.) and are well documented with photographic displays. Day-by-day life, both civilian and military, and the policy of both occupants is shown in the rich narrative scenography of the exhibition, based on documents and artefacts such as uniforms, munitions, many documents and decorations.\nThe main part of the exhibition is situated in the basement. Visitors are confronted with hundreds of photos and memorabilia telling stories of selected Home Army members. One of the most precious exhibits is the diary of a famous major \"Hubal\" – Henryk Dobrzański, the first guerilla commander of the World War II in Europe. Among other artefacts there is a replica of a fuselage section of Halifax (British heavy bomber) and a reconstructed inner structure of a V-2 rocket. The reconstruction of a detention cell in which after 1944 Polish Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Department of Security) held members of the Home Army and postwar Freedom and Independence organisation gives the opportunity to experience the communist terror. The museum has an extensive weapon collection, including homemade projectiles.\nThe museum is located at Ulica Wita Stwosza 12, in the Grzegórzki District of Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Wita Stwosza\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Armii Krajowej;Muzeum Armii Krajowej im.

Originally a standard ravelin fort from 1861–1866. Twin to Bastion III „Kleparz”. \nThe plan of the bastion with a central ravelin and a classical ditch with caponiers. \nAround 1888, the object underwent modernization with the construction of traverses on the rampart. After 1907, artillery barracks were added. During World War II, the fort's buildings served as warehouses. The fort was partially demolished and leveled, and then filled with earth in 1950. \nCurrently, the site of the bastion is occupied by Rondo Mogilskie. The ruins of the bastion were uncovered and displayed during a thorough reconstruction of the roundabout. The conservation work on the ruins was completed in December 2008.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : surface\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Relikty bastionu V \"Lubicz\"\nid : 3372\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9582525 50.0428681, 19.9583102 50.0428108, 19.958329 50.042744, 19.9583071 50.0426776, 19.9582472 50.0426217, 19.9581584 50.0425847, 19.9580544 50.0425726, 19.9579516 50.0425868, 19.9578649 50.0426256, 19.9578066 50.0426824, 19.9577886 50.0427495, 19.9578085 50.0428115, 19.9578101 50.0428164, 19.9578314 50.0428362, 19.9578401 50.0428443, 19.9578496 50.0428531, 19.9578702 50.0428723, 19.9578768 50.0428749, 19.9579596 50.0429088, 19.9580634 50.0429207, 19.9581662 50.0429063, 19.9582525 50.0428681), (19.958008 50.0427697, 19.9580009 50.0427631, 19.9579955 50.0427476, 19.9579998 50.042732, 19.9580132 50.0427186, 19.9580233 50.042714, 19.9580334 50.0427094, 19.9580576 50.042706, 19.958082 50.0427088, 19.9581029 50.0427173, 19.9581099 50.0427238, 19.958117 50.0427304, 19.9581224 50.0427459, 19.9581181 50.0427615, 19.9581048 50.0427749, 19.9580946 50.0427795, 19.9580845 50.042784, 19.9580603 50.0427875, 19.9580359 50.0427847, 19.9580151 50.0427762, 19.958008 50.0427697))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort 31 \"Św.

It was built between 1885 and 1886, most likely designed by Daniel Salis-Soglio, and based on its model, three forts were constructed in the Przemyśl Fortress. Fort 52 \"Borek\" belonged to the VIII defensive sector of the Kraków Fortress, covering the areas between the valleys of the Wilga and the upper Vistula. It is a double-ring artillery fort. The higher rampart was intended for artillery, while the lower one was for infantry and light guns. The caponiers were equipped with machine guns and later with automatic rifles. The fort features the first three-level underground intersection in Kraków for the movement of soldiers and transportation of armaments.  \nThe fort's task was to guard the exits of main roads and to defend the Vienna route (now known as Zakopianka) and approaches to the fortress ring from the direction of Libertów. The fort did not participate in the battles of World War I.  \nDuring World War II, Russian and French prisoners were held in the fort. On December 26, 1944, an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was forced to land with its landing gear retracted in front of the fort. It had been damaged during a raid on the refinery in Blechhammer (now: Blachownia, part of Kędzierzyn-Koźle), and its crew attempted to reach areas controlled by the Red Army. Until the 1990s, there was a vehicle and equipment base of a construction cooperative located here. For several years, it remained unused and was in poor technical condition. From 2013 to 2022, the fort underwent revitalization, and since July 30, 2022, it has been managed by the Podgórze Cultural Center and is the seat of the Polish Song Library. In the place where the American bomber landed in 1944, trees grew after the war. In June 2022, the area was developed and made available to residents as a park.  \nFort 52 Borek is located between Korpala, Władysław Krygowski, and Forteczna streets in Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : arts_centre\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Forteczna\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : info@ckpodgorza.pl\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Centrum Kultury Podgórza - Fort Borek;fort Borek\nid : 3582\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9920443 49.9948323, 19.9920239 49.9948523, 19.9919712 49.9948286, 19.9919906 49.9948095, 19.9918014 49.9947269, 19.9917981 49.9947298, 19.9916796 49.994678, 19.9917668 49.9945711, 19.9924046 49.9948483, 19.9924023 49.9948789, 19.9924268 49.9949105, 19.9924463 49.9949224, 19.992454 49.9949327, 19.9924059 49.9949856, 19.9923786 49.994983, 19.9922277 49.9949168, 19.9922307 49.9949136, 19.9920443 49.9948323))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort 50 ½ O Kosocice – one of the forts of the Kraków Fortress.

It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Fort 44 \"Tonie\"\nid : 3693\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((20.0404114 50.0987452, 20.0405076 50.0987144, 20.0417472 50.0986841, 20.0418206 50.0987123, 20.0419386 50.0986665, 20.0419346 50.0985867, 20.0422783 50.0982016, 20.0424136 50.0981943, 20.0424056 50.0981037, 20.0423085 50.0980261, 20.0413639 50.0980551, 20.0411966 50.0979653, 20.0409156 50.0980472, 20.0399161 50.098093, 20.0398499 50.0981353, 20.0398346 50.0981972, 20.0398587 50.0982339, 20.0399218 50.0982853, 20.0400018 50.0983595, 20.0404114 50.0987452))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 49a Dłubnia – a historic fort of the Kraków Fortress.

  "answer": "Based on the provided context, **Fort 52 \"Borek\"** (now the **Podgórze Cultural Center – Fort Borek**) was used during **World War II as a prison for Russian and French prisoners of war**. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the available information:\n\n### **Prisoners Held at Fort 52 Borek (1939–1945)**\n1. **Nationalities of Prisoners**:\n   - **Russian (Soviet) POWs**: Likely captured during the early phases of Operation Barbarossa (1941–1942) or earlier conflicts.\n   - **French POWs**: Probably captured during the 1940 Battle of France or later resistance activities. France had many prisoners in German-occupied Poland, some of whom were sent to labor camps or forts like Borek.\n\n2. **Conditions & Context**:\n   - The fort was repurposed as a detention site, though specific details about prisoner treatment, numbers, or fates are **not explicitly documented in the provided context**.\n   - No evidence suggests it was a major extermination site (unlike Płaszów nearby), but forts like Borek were often used for **transit, forced labor, or temporary imprisonment** before transfers to larger camps.\n   - The fort’s **underground tunnels and reinforced structure** made it suitable for detaining prisoners, though conditions were likely harsh (overcrowding, poor sanitation, etc.).\n\n3. **Notable Event (1944)**:\n   - On **December 26, 1944**, a damaged **American B-17 Flying Fortress** (from a raid on Blechhammer) crash-landed near the fort. The crew attempted to reach Soviet lines, but their fate is unclear. This suggests the fort was in a **militarized zone** during late 1944, possibly under German control until the Red Army’s advance in January 1945.\n\n4. **Post-War Use**:\n   - After WWII, the fort was used as a **vehicle/equipment base** until the 1990s, with no mention of memorials for prisoners. Revitalization (2013–2022) focused on cultural use, not commemoration.\n\n---\n\n### **Where to Find More Information**\nSince the context lacks granular details about the prisoners, here are **actionable steps** to deepen your research:\n\n1. **Archival Sources**:\n   - **Polish State Archives (Archiwum Państwowe w Krakowie)**:\n     - Request records on **German military administration in Kraków (1939–1945)** or **POW camps in Małopolska**.\n     - Focus on **\"Stalag\" (POW camp) documents**—Fort Borek may have been a sub-camp.\n   - **Arolsen Archives (Germany)**:\n     - Search their [online database](https://arolsen-archives.org/) for French/Russian POWs held in Kraków.\n\n2. **Local Museums & Institutions**:\n   - **Home Army Museum (Muzeum Armii Krajowej)**:\n     - Their exhibits on **German occupation** (including Płaszów and forts) may have references to Borek.\n     - **Address**: Ul. Wita Stwosza 12 | **Hours**: Tue–Sun 11:00–17:00 | [Website](https://www.muzeum-ak.pl/)\n   - **Kraków Fortress Museum (Muzeum Twierdzy Kraków)**:\n     - Manages several forts (e.g., Fort 50½ Kosocice) and may have **unpublished records** on Borek’s WWII use.\n     - Contact via [Fortress Museum Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MuzeumTwierdzyKrakow/).\n\n3. **Books & Academic Papers**:\n   - **\"Kraków under Nazi Occupation\"** by Andrzej Chwalba (mentions forts as detention sites).\n   - **\"The Fortress Kraków\"** by Marek Jabłonowski (covers military use of forts in WWII).\n   - **French/Soviet POW memoirs**: Check libraries like **Jagiellonian University** for firsthand accounts.\n\n4. **On-Site Visit**:\n   - **Fort Borek Cultural Center**:\n     - While now a cultural venue, staff may know of **oral histories** or local researchers.\n     - **Address**: Ul. Forteczna (Podgórze) | **Email**: info@ckpodgorza.pl | [Website](https://borek.ckpodgorza.pl/)\n     - Ask about **guided tours focusing on WWII history** (not regularly advertised).\n\n5. **Memorials & Nearby Sites**:\n   - **Hujowa Górka (Chujowa Górka)**: A mass execution site for Płaszów prisoners (mostly Jews). While unrelated to Borek, it reflects the **brutality of Kraków’s occupation**.\n   - **Płaszów Concentration Camp Memorial**: Some French POWs were sent there; their archives might overlap with Borek’s.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Unanswered Questions (For Further Research)**\n- Were prisoners at Borek **transferred to Płaszów or Auschwitz**?\n- Were there **executions or escapes** recorded at the fort?\n- Are there **surviving prisoner lists** in German military logs?\n\n---\n### **Summary**\nFort 52 Borek **held Russian and French POWs** during WWII, but specific details are scarce. For deeper insights, **contact archives, visit the Home Army Museum, or explore the Fort Borek Cultural Center’s resources**. If you’re researching a specific prisoner, the **Arolsen Archives** are your best bet.",
