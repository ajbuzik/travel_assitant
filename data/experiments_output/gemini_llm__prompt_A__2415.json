Originally established as a private pharmacy in 1910, during World War II it operated within the Kraków Ghetto. Its owner, Tadeusz Pankiewicz, was the only non-Jewish Pole permitted to remain and operate a business inside the ghetto. The pharmacy served as a vital hub for clandestine aid, communication, and resistance, providing shelter, medical supplies, and moral support to the persecuted Jewish community. \nAfter the war, the site was gradually transformed into a commemorative museum. The permanent exhibition opened in 2003 following contributions from Holocaust survivor and filmmaker Roman Polanski.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Plac Bohaterów Getta\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : limited\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Apteka Pod Orłem;Eagle Pharmacy;Patika a Sas Alatt\nid : 2424\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Apr-Oct: Mo-Su 10:00-17:30; Nov-Mar: Mo-Tu off; We-Su 10:00-17:00\nwebsite : https://muzeumkrakowa.pl/oddzialy/ulica-pomorska\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9249265 50.0706881)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Historical Museum of the City of Kraków (Polish: Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Krakowa) in Kraków, Lesser Poland, was granted the status of an independent institution in 1945.

It is the oldest synagogue building still standing in Poland, and one of the most precious landmarks of Jewish architecture in Europe. The synagogue served as a house of prayer until World War II when it was desecrated by Nazis in 1939.

Originally, it was located on the southern side of the former Kazimierski Market, of which a small fragment is the present Plac Wolnica. Residential buildings within the market are not an exception; similar ones were located in the Main Market Square in Kraków (or the \"merchant houses\" in the Old Market in Poznań). The Dom Esterki is the only preserved residential house that originally stood at the Kazimierz market (a house formed by the merging of two smaller ones). The oldest part of the cellars of this originally Gothic building dates back to the 14th century, and then the building was remodeled almost every century (the last time in 1876, while its current appearance is mainly due to the renovations carried out at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries). To this day, fragments of Gothic stonework from around 1430 and slightly later (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) have been preserved. In the late 18th century, wooden ceilings were made, and rich polychromy of the walls and ceiling rosettes also date from this period. In the 16th century, the house belonged to the architect and builder working at the court of Polish King Sigismund the Old, and Kazimierz councilor Bartolomeo Bereccy, and later to his daughter Anna. The building is currently topped with a rarely encountered classicist broken roof (the so-called Krakow roof). The name of the building refers to the legend of Esterka, the Jewish bride of King Casimir the Great. Her name is also associated with several other places in Kraków: Ester Street, Esterka Mound, and a small tenement that stood until 1932 at the junction of Szczepański Square and Reformacka Street. Since a thorough renovation took place from 1978 to 1985, Dom Esterki has housed a branch of the nearby Ethnographic Museum. Previously, in the 1950s and 60s, a coffee bar \"Esterka\" operated here.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Etnograficzne (Dom Esterki);Néprajzi Múzeum (Esterka-ház)\nid : 3540\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9087754 50.0549646, 19.9088087 50.0550642, 19.9088759 50.0550554, 19.908881 50.0550678, 19.9089439 50.0550587, 19.9089391 50.0550453, 19.9089768 50.0550399, 19.9089443 50.0549395, 19.9087754 50.0549646))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Zwierzyniecki House (formerly Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon) is a branch of the Museum of Krakow located at 41 Queen Hedwig Street in Zwierzyńec, Krakow, at the foot of The Mountain of St. Bronisławy, near the monastery of Ss. Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name :

district at J. Piłsudski Street 27, in the Piasek area. The \"Sokół\" Gymnastic Society was established on February 23, 1885, at the initiative of students associated with the so-called Academic Reading Room of Jagiellonian University. Its goal was to spiritually and physically revive society by cultivating national traditions, patriotic education, and engaging in sports activities, mainly of a paramilitary nature. The \"Sokół\" Society was formed within the framework of the \"Reading Room.\" It promoted tourism, gymnastics, and various sports: rowing, shooting, fencing, archery, swimming, athletics, and more. In 1889, the city municipality provided the Society with land on what was then Wolska Street, right by the river Rudawa that flowed there at the time. In the same year, a building was constructed, the falconry. It housed the largest gymnasium in Galicia, equipped with the most modern sports facilities. The edifice was designed by Karol Knaus. The official opening of the building took place on November 18, 1889. In 1894, the falconry was expanded. An eastern part designed by Teodor Talowski was added, giving the building neo-Gothic features. In 1921, the Kraków District of the Polish Gymnastic Society \"Sokół\" was based in the building. On July 31, 1947, representatives of the Security Office sealed the \"Sokół\" building, revoking its permit for operation. From 1957, the building was administered by TKKF. \"Sokół\" regained its building in September 1990 and started a major renovation of the building that had been devastated by the previous user, the Cracovia Sports Club. From 2017 to 2020, the first comprehensive renovation and conservation work since the building's inception took place. Almost the entire cost was financed by the National Fund for the Revaluation of Kraków Monuments granted by the Social Committee for the Renewal of Kraków Monuments. On May 15, 1984, the building was entered into the register of monuments. It is also included in the municipal register of monuments.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : sports_centre\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : no\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Hala Sokoła\nid : 11492\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes, the Galicia Jewish Museum is located in the historic Jewish district of Kraków, known as Kazimierz.\n\nKazimierz was once a separate town and served as the center of Jewish life in Kraków for centuries. It was a vibrant hub of religious, cultural, and social activity, boasting numerous synagogues, yeshivas, and Jewish businesses. The district's rich history is evident in its architecture and atmosphere, making it a significant area for understanding Jewish heritage in Poland. The Galicia Jewish Museum itself plays a crucial role in preserving and showcasing this heritage through its exhibitions.",
