It is popularly known as Zwis. For years, it housed the informal office of Piwnica pod Baranami, a place for regular meetings of people associated with this cabaret. In front of the entrance stands a statue of Piotr Skrzynecki, the leader and master of ceremonies of the Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret, who was once a regular at this café. The statue was funded by composer Zbigniew Preisner. The sculpture was made by Grażyna Borkowska-Niemojewska and Łukasz Niemojewski. The café is still frequented mainly by artists: painters, poets, singers, sculptors, musicians, and actors, as well as photographers and filmmakers, and well-known figures from Kraków.\n\nNotable past and present patrons of the bar include poet Marcin Świetlicki (who immortalized the venue in his poem Do Zwisu i z powrotem and the crime novel Dwanaście), musician Andrzej Sikorowski, poet Tadeusz Śliwiak, critic Paweł Głowacki, musician Leszek Wójtowicz, and actor Jan Nowicki. A frequent visitor to Zwis was the famous Kloszard Zbigniew Fijałkowski, a character in numerous incidents and stories. Since 2007, bar patrons have published a magazine called \"Vis a vis,\" available in print and online. The illustrations for it are created by Iwona Siwek-Front, featuring daily stories about the Iced Gingerbread Woman with an impure soul. A comic by the artist that illustrates the social life of the local community and Vis-à-vis patrons hangs permanently in the bar. For many years, the bartender at Zwis has been Kraków poet Marek Wawrzyński, whose poetry collection – Na stronach – had its promotion at Piwnica.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : bar\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Rynek Główny\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : yes\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Vis-à-vis\nid : 1162\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://wawel.krakow.pl/wystawa-stala/wawel-zaginiony-1\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9363047 50.0540886)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Wawel Zaginiony – an archaeological-architectural reserve and permanent exhibition, located in a former German building from the 1940s, built on the site of the former royal kitchens at Wawel.

The museum is named after general Emil August Fieldorf \"Nil\". It is the only such institution in Poland promoting knowledge about the Polish Underground State and its armed forces during World War II. The idea behind the Home Army Museum is to provide a holistic picture of the Polish underground, its spiritual origins and the shape of patriotic heritage to the present day.\nThe museum was established in 2000 as a local self-government unit but the formal establishment was preceded by a ten-year effort of collecting the historical items of the Home Army Veterans. So far, the museum has collected more than 8,000 exhibits and more than 12,000 archives – mostly gifts of Army Soldiers and their families around the world – historical memorabilia, often with the tenor of relics. The library resources reach about 11,500 volumes.\n\nThe permanent exhibition presents the history of Polish Underground State and Home Army in their complexity. The main section of the exhibition begins with the so-called September Campaign (Invasion of Poland, 1939). The division of Poland into two occupied zones, German and Soviet, consists of several sections (pe. Society, Terror, concentration camps, Holocaust and attitude of the Underground State towards persecuted Jews, etc.) and are well documented with photographic displays. Day-by-day life, both civilian and military, and the policy of both occupants is shown in the rich narrative scenography of the exhibition, based on documents and artefacts such as uniforms, munitions, many documents and decorations.\nThe main part of the exhibition is situated in the basement. Visitors are confronted with hundreds of photos and memorabilia telling stories of selected Home Army members. One of the most precious exhibits is the diary of a famous major \"Hubal\" – Henryk Dobrzański, the first guerilla commander of the World War II in Europe. Among other artefacts there is a replica of a fuselage section of Halifax (British heavy bomber) and a reconstructed inner structure of a V-2 rocket. The reconstruction of a detention cell in which after 1944 Polish Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Department of Security) held members of the Home Army and postwar Freedom and Independence organisation gives the opportunity to experience the communist terror. The museum has an extensive weapon collection, including homemade projectiles.\nThe museum is located at Ulica Wita Stwosza 12, in the Grzegórzki District of Kraków.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Wita Stwosza\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Armii Krajowej;Muzeum Armii Krajowej im.

It is named after Jalu Kurk, a Polish poet and prose writer, representative of the so-called Krakow Avant-Garde. \n\nThe park initially served as the garden of the Montelupich Palace, built in this place in the 15th century. It was common property until the property of the palace was taken over by the Tarnowski family. Stanisław Tarnowski, after remodeling the palace, transferred the palace garden to the city for public use by all residents. In 1948, the Congregation of the Salvatorians purchased the palace along with the park from the Tarnowskis. \n\nAfter World War II, the grounds of the palace and park were taken over by the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. The palace housed the headquarters of Radio Kraków, and the park was fully opened to the city's residents. \n\nAfter 1989, when a property commission for the Catholic Church was established, the congregation applied to the commission for the return of the palace and the adjacent park. The park was returned to the congregation, while the request for the return of the palace was withdrawn by the congregation when the Tarnowski family began efforts to declare the expropriation invalid. \n\nAfter the congregation regained the park, despite numerous protests from local residents, students from the nearby Krakow University of Technology, and councilors from District I, the park was closed. The congregation officially stated that the reason for the park's closure was the lack of funds for repairing the lighting and infrastructure of the park. \n\nIn 2008, the owners of the park applied for development conditions for part of the parkland, wishing to build the European Center for Salvatorian Formation on that site. They also informed that if they received permission for development, the remaining part of the park would be made available to the city's residents. However, the proposal for development was rejected by Jan Janczykowski, the provincial conservator of monuments. \n\nCurrently, an office building is being constructed on a part of the plot that is not protected, which previously served as the entrance to the park. \n\nSince 2017, the authorities of the city of Krakow have been in discussions with the Salvatorians regarding land exchange or the purchase of the park. Ultimately, in 2022, the Krakow municipality purchased the park area for the amount of 11 million PLN. The park was made available to residents on January 1, 2023. The park is open daily from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : no

Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 17th most visited art museum in the world.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Zamek Wawel;Wawel;Wawelburg;Kasteel van Wawel\nid : 4019\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9414953 50.0634912)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Hotel Pollera – a historic hotel located in Kraków at Szpitalna Street 30, on the corner of St. Mark's Street and St. Spirit Square, in the Old Town.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : hotel\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Hotel Pollera\nid : 6321\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9361073 50.0547467)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Wawel Royal Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl] ; Zamek Królewski na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland.
