His intention was to receive a blessing prior to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. For the next two centuries the meadow belonged to nuns, who in 1366 exchanged it with the city's authorities for a manor at Florianska Street. The meadow was used by peasants from neighboring villages to graze their cattle.\nUntil the 19th century Błonia Park was largely neglected, and often flooded by the Rudawa river in the spring turning it into wetland with small islands, probably contributing to the spread of epidemics. After draining the swamps, Błonia became perfectly suitable to host large gatherings. In 1809, when the city was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw, Błonia was a place of salute of the troops of Napoleon, organized by Prince Jozef Poniatowski and General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski.  \nToday Błonia is a recreation area, frequently hosting large events like concerts and exhibitions. The place is best known for great Masses celebrated by Pope John Paul II in 1979, 1983, 1987, 1997 and 2002. Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated the Mass there during his journey to Poland in May 2006. The opening Mass of the 2016 World Youth Day was held at Błonia Park in July 2016, however the main events, including the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis, were held outside the city.\nBłonia Park is also used to host popular culture events, such as concerts organized by a local radio station or the Iuvenalia student festival. Pop star Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour concert on June 28, 2008 performed to nearly 55,000 people  The vast meadow was also used for politicized promotion of the Małopolska region farming industry by PSL in 2011 with a herd of 150 sheep trucked in from hundreds of kilometres away for one month, and the city permit worth 3,200 złoty. The last cattle grazed at Błonia in the 1970s.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Błonia krakowskie\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : limited\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Błonia;Błonia krakowskie;Lange Wiese;Краковский луг\nid : 3430\n\nphone : +48 12 422 05 21\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo-Sa 11:30-18:00; Su 14:00-18:00\nwebsite : https://mariacki.com\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9389202 50.0616958, 19.9389203 50.061699, 19.9389308 50.0616987, 19.9389329 50.0617701, 19.9390219 50.061769, 19.9390222 50.0617899, 19.939069 50.0617897, 19.9390689 50.0617933, 19.9390767 50.061793, 19.9390802 50.0618409, 19.939344 50.0618351, 19.939351 50.0618316, 19.9393529 50.0618287, 19.9393987 50.0618276, 19.9394004 50.0618305, 19.9394044 50.0618316, 19.9394074 50.0618335, 19.9395723 50.0618301, 19.9395709 50.0618076, 19.9396872 50.0618003, 19.9398112 50.0617858, 19.9398073 50.0617685, 19.9399081 50.0617606, 19.9399015 50.0617225, 19.9399401 50.0617198, 19.93994 50.0617183, 19.9399602 50.061717, 19.9399606 50.0617186, 19.9399692 50.061718, 19.9399702 50.0617194, 19.9399813 50.0617187, 19.9399899 50.0617279, 19.9399952 50.0617288, 19.9400217 50.0617113, 19.9400209 50.0617098, 19.9400369 50.0616991, 19.9400395 50.0616999, 19.9400659 50.0616821, 19.9400651 50.0616789, 19.9400511 50.0616717, 19.940056 50.061665, 19.9400547 50.0616639, 19.9400564 50.0616076, 19.940059 50.0616066, 19.9400525 50.0615991, 19.940068 50.0615934, 19.9400674 50.0615901, 19.9399952 50.0615393, 19.9399396 50.0615406, 19.9399397 50.0615398, 19.9399158 50.0615402, 19.9399161 50.0615412, 19.939878 50.0615421, 19.9398787 50.0615519, 19.9398721 50.0615521, 19.9398723 50.0615544, 19.9397785 50.0615573, 19.9397782 50.0615557, 19.9397579 50.0615566, 19.9397579 50.0615578, 19.9397104 50.0615598, 19.9397104 50.0615587, 19.9396443 50.0615601, 19.9396455 50.0615812, 19.9396154 50.0615819, 19.9396132 50.0615889, 19.9396 50.0615893, 19.9395861 50.0615896, 19.9395829 50.0615827, 19.9395486 50.0615837, 19.9395448 50.0615299, 19.9395668 50.0615144, 19.939553 50.0614859, 19.939531 50.0614753, 19.9395071 50.0614763, 19.9393837 50.0614812, 19.9393762 50.0614839, 19.9393761 50.0614869, 19.9393269 50.0614876, 19.9393264 50.0614846, 19.9393189 50.0614835, 19.939314 50.0614832, 19.9393132 50.0614736, 19.9392723 50.0614752, 19.9392747 50.0614847, 19.9390605 50.0614909, 19.9390002 50.0614946, 19.9390017 50.0615307, 19.9390053 50.0615305, 19.9390062 50.0615472, 19.9389247 50.0615485, 19.9389213 50.0616186, 19.9389157 50.0616188, 19.9389159 50.0616254, 19.9388923 50.0616254, 19.9388892 50.0616186, 19.938877 50.0616213, 19.9388797 50.0616277, 19.9388474 50.0616408, 19.9388378 50.0616376, 19.9388319 50.0616448, 19.9388419 50.0616479, 19.938842 50.0616615, 19.9388421 50.0616746, 19.938833 50.0616782, 19.9388394 50.0616852, 19.9388485 50.0616816, 19.9388831 50.061693, 19.93888 50.0616998, 19.9388918 50.0617023, 19.9388965 50.061696, 19.9389202 50.0616958))\nhistoric : church\nwiki_summary_en : The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Polish: Kościół Wniebowzięcia Najświętszej Marii Panny), known colloquially as the St. Mary's Church (Polish: Kościół Mariacki), is a historic Roman Catholic parish church located at Mariacki Square at the north-eastern corner of the Main Market Square in the Old Town of Kraków, Poland.\nIt is a Brick Gothic church. Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz). Some of its monumental polychrome murals were designed by Poland's leading history painter, Jan Matejko (1838–1893). In 1978, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nOn every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, a trumpet signal—called the Hejnał mariacki—is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary's two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream, to commemorate a famous 13th-century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by Polish Radio Jedynka.\nSaint Mary's Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint Michael's and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral style.\nThe church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1928 book The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Kościół pw.

Its almost 1000-year-old history goes back to the beginning of the Polish Romanesque architecture of the early Middle Ages. Throughout the early history of Kraków the Church of St. Wojciech was a place of worship first visited by merchants travelling from across Europe. It was a place where citizens and nobility would meet.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : place_of_worship\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Church_of_St_Adalbert,_2_Main_Market_square,Old_Town,Krakow,Poland.jpg\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kościół pw.

A grade-separated intersection of the axial road (Waliszewskiego Street) and the access road to the Pękowice fort (Pękowicka Street), preventing congestion that could arise during combat when troops were simultaneously regrouping along both roads. This could have had very serious consequences, which is why about 100 years ago, a two-level intersection was built on the then far outskirts of the city. Recently, renovation work restored Czerwony Most to its original appearance.  \nBeneath Czerwony Most runs the Eagle's Nests Trail, which coincides with the former medieval trade route connecting Kraków with Częstochowa and further – with Greater Poland. A section of the cultural and pilgrimage trail Via Regia also runs here, which is one of the St. James' Ways leading to the sanctuary of this saint in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Czerwony Most\nid : 3598\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8485789 50.0499758)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Pustelnik (355 m above sea level) is the second highest hill (after Sowińca) in the area of Kraków, located in the western part of the Sowińca massif within the Wolski Forest.

It serves as a junction for a short northern ridge that ends at Łysa Góra. The Kraków Zoo is located on Pustelnik.  \nAt the summit of Pustelnik is the Polana Jacka Malczewskiego, which he often visited.

It rises about 70 m above the level of the Vistula River flowing right next to it. It is located within the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park. It is the westernmost elevation of the Tyniec Hills. Along with the Piekarskie Rocks located on the opposite bank of the Vistula, it creates a gorge known as the Tyniecka Gate. Grodzisko is built of facies limestones containing flint. In its upper parts, these limestones transition to rocky limestones without flint. Dark gray, almost black epicrystalline silicifications are exposed along the path above a small quarry in the rocky limestones. \n\nOn the hill, there are traces of a long-existing settlement, with the oldest remnants dating back to the Lusatian culture (archaeological research was conducted here by Gabriel Leńczyk in the mid-20th century). There is a legend associated with this hill about Walgierz Wdały and Helgunda, with conjectures that this hill was the ancestral center of the Starżów-Toporczyk family. The lowered, marshy center of the hill, where a pond was once located (filled in around 1850), was called Tańcula, as a place of recreation. In the past, the hill was agricultural land, which over time, after farming ceased, became overgrown with forest. \n\nAt the southwestern foot of Grodzisko, there is a Shelter under Grodzisko, and to the west, an inactive quarry, Grodzisko.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Góra Grodzisko\nid : 11411\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8258642 50.0140052)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Duża Kowodrza (273 m) – a two-peaked hill in Tyniec, Kraków. Administratively, it belongs to District VIII Dębniki. Geographically, it is part of the Tyniec Hills on the Kraków Bridge within the macroregion of the Kraków Gate. These hills have been incorporated into the area of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park. The lower (261 m) western peak is described in some sources as Kowadza Hill. There is an ecological site named Uroczysko Kowadza on it.  \nDuża Kowodrza rises above Skołczanka and Obrony Tyńca streets. It is covered with a forest, in the middle of which are clearings. They are covered with thin soil overgrown with xerothermic grasslands. In places, limestone rocks protrude, bare or covered with mosses and lichens. It is a place for recreation, walks, and sports activities. Paths lead along all its slopes, and a marked tourist trail runs through the hill. It is located in the area of the Skołczanka nature reserve.  \nIn the southern part of the hill, there are two mass graves, where about 500 Jews from the vicinity of Kraków rest—victims of the German genocide murdered in the summer of 1942. Above, on the rocky slope, there is a Catholic center for religious worship; a picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary mounted on the rock wall, a field altar, and benches for the faithful.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Duża Kowodrza\nid : 11438\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9361073 50.0547467)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Wawel Royal Castle (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvavɛl] ; Zamek Królewski na Wawelu) and the Wawel Hill on which it sits constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in Poland. A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum's holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art. With over 3.1 million visitors in 2024, Wawel Castle is the most visited art museum in Poland and the 17th most visited art museum in the world.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Wawel;Vavel\nid : 11464\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9460077 50.0683671, 19.9460257 50.0683914, 19.9460713 50.0683775, 19.9460533 50.0683532, 19.9460077 50.0683671))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : no information\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : ice_cream\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : no\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : 4D\nid : 2263\n\n",
