It was painted on the retaining wall of Lasota Hill along al. Powstańców Śląskich, near the Kraków Krzemionki train station. In May 2007, it was probably the largest historical mural in the world (5 meters high and 90 meters long).  \nThe idea was submitted in a competition for jubilee events by the Zooteka agency. The graphic design of the mural, developed by Jerzy Rojkowski (an artist – then a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków) with substantive input from Artur L. Zakrzewski and Tomasz Kubik (Zooteka) and Kraków historians, was approved by the Program Council for the 750th Anniversary of the Founding of Kraków and was endorsed by the Historical Museum of the City of Kraków. The mural was commissioned by the City Hall of Kraków, as a result of winning the competition for jubilee events.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : artwork\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mural_Silva_Rerum,Powstancow_Slaskich_street,Podgorze,Krakow,Poland.JPG#mw-jump-to-license\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Silva Rerum;Dean, Malik, Turbos, Mehes, Forin, Impas2000, Cybe, Szejn, Nawer, Cejn, Mck, Maze, Noude, Merazster\nid : 2520\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : MULTIPOLYGON (((19.9414616 50.0648576, 19.941469 50.0648563, 19.9421795 50.0647424, 19.9421714 50.064722, 19.9415238 50.064827, 19.9415211 50.0648187, 19.9415268 50.0648178, 19.9415234 50.0648106, 19.9415179 50.0648112, 19.9415152 50.0648058, 19.9415075 50.0648072, 19.941509 50.0648127, 19.9415031 50.0648137, 19.941504 50.064816, 19.9414705 50.0648208, 19.9414691 50.0648184, 19.9414639 50.0648194, 19.9414621 50.0648139, 19.941454 50.0648152, 19.941456 50.0648208, 19.9414483 50.0648216, 19.9414347 50.0648237, 19.9414211 50.0648258, 19.9414083 50.0648276, 19.9414105 50.0648333, 19.9414145 50.0648438, 19.9414223 50.0648638, 19.9414344 50.0648618, 19.941448 50.0648597, 19.9414616 50.0648576)), ((19.940697 50.0649973, 19.9412442 50.0648949, 19.9412975 50.0648848, 19.9412894 50.0648638, 19.9411661 50.0648871, 19.9406938 50.0649763, 19.940697 50.0649973)))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The city walls in Krakow – a series of city walls along with defensive structures (including gates and towers), which once surrounded the entire area of Krakow (now the Old Town), of which a small section has been preserved to this day along Pijarska Street.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Mury miejskie Krakowa;Krakauer Stadtmauer;Városfal\nid : 3378\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : 24/7\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : MULTIPOLYGON (((19.9329885 50.0633368, 19.9330252 50.0633213, 19.9330028 50.0632995, 19.9329661 50.063315, 19.9329885 50.0633368)), ((19.9330725 50.0634102, 19.9331796 50.0633475, 19.9331542 50.0633223, 19.9330448 50.0633857, 19.9330725 50.0634102)))\nhistoric : memorial\nwiki_summary_en : The Szewska Gate – a non-preserved gate that was once part of the city walls and fortifications in Krakow.

In 1645 the gate collapsed due to swampy ground, but it was rebuilt, expanded, and strengthened. During the Deluge, the gate was heavily attacked by Swedish artillery fire.

A grade-separated intersection of the axial road (Waliszewskiego Street) and the access road to the Pękowice fort (Pękowicka Street), preventing congestion that could arise during combat when troops were simultaneously regrouping along both roads. This could have had very serious consequences, which is why about 100 years ago, a two-level intersection was built on the then far outskirts of the city. Recently, renovation work restored Czerwony Most to its original appearance.  \nBeneath Czerwony Most runs the Eagle's Nests Trail, which coincides with the former medieval trade route connecting Kraków with Częstochowa and further – with Greater Poland. A section of the cultural and pilgrimage trail Via Regia also runs here, which is one of the St. James' Ways leading to the sanctuary of this saint in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Czerwony Most\nid : 3598\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9087754 50.0549646, 19.9088087 50.0550642, 19.9088759 50.0550554, 19.908881 50.0550678, 19.9089439 50.0550587, 19.9089391 50.0550453, 19.9089768 50.0550399, 19.9089443 50.0549395, 19.9087754 50.0549646))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Zwierzyniecki House (formerly Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon) is a branch of the Museum of Krakow located at 41 Queen Hedwig Street in Zwierzyńec, Krakow, at the foot of The Mountain of St. Bronisławy, near the monastery of Ss. Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Królowej Jadwigi\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Dom Zwierzyniecki;Zwierzyniec House;Zwierzyniec Ház\nid : 3613\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8958066 50.1235526, 19.8957283 50.1236371, 19.8956141 50.1237774, 19.8954784 50.1240811, 19.8954087 50.1241273, 19.8953712 50.1241711, 19.8953551 50.1242187, 19.89539 50.124275, 19.8959546 50.124685, 19.8964093 50.1249883, 19.8964842 50.1250553, 19.8965646 50.1250837, 19.8966584 50.1250858, 19.8967536 50.1250748, 19.8968247 50.1250501, 19.8988446 50.1247998, 19.898931 50.1247695, 19.8989707 50.1247108, 19.8989729 50.1246555, 19.8989718 50.124569, 19.8990823 50.1242494, 19.8992193 50.1239942, 19.8992556 50.1238546, 19.8992497 50.1237641, 19.8991847 50.1237098, 19.899113 50.1236739, 19.8989811 50.1236632, 19.8982268 50.1236766, 19.8980867 50.1236275, 19.8979995 50.1236461, 19.897938 50.1236901, 19.8977665 50.1239124, 19.8973259 50.1238353, 19.8970812 50.1237894, 19.8959081 50.1235715, 19.8958066 50.1235526))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 44 Tonie – a historic armored fort of the Kraków Fortress. It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription :

information\nwiki_summary_en : Planty is one of the largest city parks in Kraków, Poland. It encircles the Stare Miasto (Old Town), where the Medieval city walls used to stand until the early 19th century. The historic Old Town is not to be confused with the Administrative District No. 1 Stare Miasto extending further east.\nThe park has an area of 21 ha (52 acres) and a length of 4 km (2.5 mi). It consists of a chain of thirty smaller gardens designed in varied styles and adorned with numerous monuments and fountains. There are over twenty statues of noble historical figures in the park including monuments to Nicolaus Copernicus, Jan Matejko, Queen Jadwiga and King Wladyslaw II Jagiello. There are also several plaques in the park commemorating, among others, Jan Dlugosz and Stanislaw Wyspianski.  And of famous Polish Mathematician Hugo Steinhaus, Stefan Banach and Otto Nikodym.\nThe park forms a scenic walkway popular with Cracovians. In summer, sprinkled with ponds and refreshment stalls, it is a cool and shady retreat from the nearby bustling streets. \nMost historic sites of the old Kraków are located inside the Planty-park-belt along the Royal Road (Polish: Droga Królewska) crossing the park from the medieval suburb of Kleparz – through Florian Gate – at the northern flank of the old city walls. The historic Wawel Castle at the Wawel Hill, adjacent to Vistula River meander, form the southernmost border of Planty.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Planty Krakowskie\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Planty;Planty Park in Krakow;Planty Krakowskie\nid : 5586\n\n",
