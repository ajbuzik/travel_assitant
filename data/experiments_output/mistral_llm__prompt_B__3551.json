It is located in the western part of Krakow, in the northern part of the Sowińca Range within the Wolski Forest, on the side of Wola Justowska. These areas are part of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park.\n\nThe purpose of the reserve's protection is to preserve the only fragment of natural forest near Krakow for scientific, educational, and socio-cultural reasons, featuring picturesque exposed limestone rocks.\n\nThe area protected encompasses the lower part of a long and deep gorge known as the Wolski Doł. The limestone rocks date back to the late Jurassic period and create a gateway in Wolski Doł. This gorge is loessy in the upper part and rocky in the lower part. It has steep walls rising from several to several dozen meters.\n\nA path known as Grabowski's walkway runs along its bottom – named in honor of Ambroży Grabowski, the author of the first guidebook to Krakow and its surroundings. He also popularized the name Panieńskie Skały in 1822. In the past, they were also called Wolski Rocks or Przygrzyb.\n\nThe name of the rocks comes from the nuns of a nearby Norbertine monastery in Salwator, who took refuge in this area during the Tatar invasion in 1241. According to a popular legend, the nuns were miraculously saved from disgrace and death at the last moment, as the rocks closed behind them, protecting them from the assailants. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands today at the site of the alleged miracle. According to another version, when the Tartars were pursuing the nuns, the rocks collapsed beneath them, shielding them from disgrace. Supposedly there is a chamber and a table beneath the rocks where they gather to pray, which could still be seen through a crack in the rock until recently.\n\nThe slopes are covered with a natural beech forest (the oldest in the Wolski Forest area, with most trees around 140-160 years old) mixed with oak, pine, hornbeam, and sycamore. The stand was protected since 1917 when the forest was purchased by the Savings Bank of the City of Krakow. As a result, very old specimens of flowering common ivy have survived in the Wolski Forest (ivy flowers only at several decades of age). In the forest undergrowth in spring, before the trees develop their leaves, bloom: rue-leaved globe flower, wood anemone, persistent water crowfoot, twisted-leaved buttercup, full-flowered mercurialis, Rivina violet, creeping bugle, and common hepatica. There is also common butterwort, lily of the valley, and even the rare laurel-willow.\n\nNear the reserve stands a wooden church dedicated to the Mother of God Queen of Poland, where the last scene of the film \"Potop\" directed by Jerzy Hoffman was shot.\n\nA new species of predatory snail was discovered in the reserve. It has been named Falniowskia neglectissima. It is likely an endemic species and due to its rarity is listed in the Polish Red Book of Animals.\n\nIn the Panieńskie Skały, cavers have described several rock vacuums: Chimney in Panieńskie Skały, Twisted Shelter in Panieńskie Skały, Upper Shelter in the Panieńskie Skały, Shelter behind the Pillar in Panieńskie Skały, Crack in Panieńskie Skały, Tunnel in Panieńskie Skały, Niche in Panieńskie Skały.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : nature_reserve\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Rezerwat Panieńskie Skały\nid : 3551\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8338941 50.0142876, 19.8354872 50.0140019, 19.8363528 50.0137322, 19.8365161 50.0127485, 19.8364859 50.0126058, 19.8362384 50.01242, 19.8362866 50.0122907, 19.836294 50.0120521, 19.8358121 50.0122306, 19.8356155 50.0122787, 19.8354691 50.0122877, 19.835312 50.0122889, 19.8339871 50.0122232, 19.8334075 50.0122279, 19.8329132 50.01218, 19.8327777 50.01215, 19.8324483 50.0120268, 19.831826 50.0117385, 19.8313649 50.0115561, 19.8309979 50.011445, 19.8307072 50.0114, 19.8304689 50.0113932, 19.8303256 50.0113998, 19.8297702 50.011497, 19.8296072 50.0115066, 19.8287 50.0114824, 19.828123 50.0115222, 19.8279507 50.0115475, 19.8273429 50.0116632, 19.8269743 50.0121961, 19.8254343 50.0124823, 19.8250734 50.0125074, 19.8248375 50.0125008, 19.8246189 50.0123657, 19.8243995 50.0123204, 19.82392 50.012367, 19.823494 50.0124368, 19.8233405 50.0126943, 19.8231304 50.0131848, 19.8232417 50.0138485, 19.8226934 50.0146268, 19.8227531 50.0147701, 19.8228242 50.0147905, 19.8227942 50.015068, 19.8229257 50.0151739, 19.8227037 50.0156627, 19.8242619 50.0157843, 19.8248454 50.0158298, 19.826152 50.0159138, 19.8279529 50.0160623, 19.8287345 50.0161762, 19.8306751 50.0156126, 19.831628 50.0160412, 19.8325622 50.0152883, 19.8331448 50.015011, 19.8335107 50.0147571, 19.8338941 50.0142876))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Skołczanka Nature Reserve – a nature reserve in Tyniec, Kraków. It is located in Duża Kowodrza in the Tyniec Hills, within the area of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park and the Natura 2000 Dębnicko-Tyniecki meadow area. It is situated in the northernmost part of the Tyniec Hills, at the exit from the A4 motorway to Tyniec.  \nIt is a partial faunal reserve covering an area of 36.77 ha. It was established in 1957 in the then village of Tyniec. It includes a fragment of land covered with forest and communities of thermophilic shrubs, while sandy and xerothermic grasslands also occur on the edges and glades. It protects a pine-fir-beech forest, xerothermic vegetation, and in particular about 500 species of rare butterflies and hymenopterans, including the dryad stonewort.  \nThe grasslands occurring in the reserve are of semi-natural character and require active conservation measures to prevent overgrowth by trees and shrubs. Among the protected plants found here are: stemless carline thistle, red geranium, common wild thyme, meadow pasque flower, Pannonian thyme, common houseleek, lily of the valley, and common buttercup.  \nIn April 2010, part of the reserve, encompassing a grassland complex and the habitat of the dryad stonewort, burned down.  \nIn the southern part of the reserve, there are two collective graves in which about 500 Jews from the Kraków area are buried – victims of the German genocide murdered in the summer of 1942.  \n\nOn the northwest side of the Skołczanka reserve, there is a similar protected area, but with the status of an ecological use – Uroczysko Kowadza. Meanwhile, to the northeast of the reserve, an ecological use called Dąbrowa has been established.  \nThere is a marked hiking trail running through the reserve:  \n\na green loop from the Benedictine Abbey through Wielkanoc, Kowadza, Duża Kowodrza, Skołczanka reserve, Ostra Góra, Guminek, Stępnicą, Grodzisko, along the Vistula River, and back to the Benedictine Abbey. The length is approximately 8 km. This trail is called the Path of the Seven Hills.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : nature_reserve\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Rezerwat Skołczanka\nid : 3553\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : LINESTRING (19.9099889 50.1142366, 19.9101438 50.1142556, 19.9102534 50.114259)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Czerwony Most – a historic structure, one of the objects of the Austrian Fortress of Kraków.

There is a legend associated with this hill about Walgierz Wdały and Helgunda, with conjectures that this hill was the ancestral center of the Starżów-Toporczyk family. The lowered, marshy center of the hill, where a pond was once located (filled in around 1850), was called Tańcula, as a place of recreation. In the past, the hill was agricultural land, which over time, after farming ceased, became overgrown with forest. \n\nAt the southwestern foot of Grodzisko, there is a Shelter under Grodzisko, and to the west, an inactive quarry, Grodzisko.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Góra Grodzisko\nid : 11411\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8258642 50.0140052)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Duża Kowodrza (273 m) – a two-peaked hill in Tyniec, Kraków.

Administratively, it belongs to District VIII Dębniki. Geographically, it is part of the Tyniec Hills on the Kraków Bridge within the macroregion of the Kraków Gate. These hills have been included in the area of the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park.  \nKowadza rises on the eastern side of Świętojańska Street in Tyniec. Formed from limestone, the hill is mostly covered by a beech-hornbeam forest, but the summit and southern slopes are open fields of former pastures and meadows. It is covered by a thin layer of soil with xerothermic grassland. Thanks to the open areas, the summit of Kowadza is a good viewpoint. In the valley lies Uroczysko Tyniec, to the southwest the horizon is obscured by the hills of Wielkanoc and Bogucianka, to the south Guminek, and just to the east is the hill Duża Kowodrza.  \nAn ecological site named Uroczysko Kowadza, covering an area of 10 ha, has been established on Kowadza. Benches, trash bins, tourist information boards, and a shelter have been prepared for tourists. A marked hiking trail runs over the summit of Kowadza, with educational paths along its slopes.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kowodrza\nid : 11439\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : LINESTRING (19.9152505 50.0400625, 19.9151585 50.0400944, 19.9150137 50.0400107)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Baba Jaga – a part of the rock wall in the northeastern section of Krzemionki Zakrzowskie (Zakrzówek) in District VIII Dębniki in Krakow.

  "answer": "The **Panieńskie Skały Nature Reserve** (Rezerwat Panieńskie Skały) in Kraków features a scenic **gorge (Wolski Doł)** with a well-defined walking path called **Grabowski’s Walkway (Ścieżka Grabowskiego)**. This trail runs along the bottom of the gorge and is named in honor of **Ambroży Grabowski** (1782–1868), a Polish historian, librarian, and author of the first comprehensive guidebook to Kraków and its surroundings (*\"Starożytności historyczne miasta Krakowa\"*, 1822). Grabowski also popularized the name *Panieńskie Skały* (\"Maidens' Rocks\") in 1822, linking it to the local legend about nuns hiding from Tatar invaders in 1241.\n\n---\n### **Key Details for Your Visit:**\n1. **Path Description**:\n   - The **Grabowski’s Walkway** is a **linear trail** (not a loop) that winds through the lower, rocky part of the gorge, surrounded by limestone cliffs and a **140–160-year-old beech forest**.\n   - The path is **easy to moderate** (some uneven terrain) and suitable for hiking. It connects the **Wolski Forest** area near **Salwator** to the **northern slopes of the Sowińce Range**.\n   - Length: ~1–1.5 km (one way). Allow **30–60 minutes** for a leisurely walk, including stops to admire the rocks, caves, and forest.\n\n2. **Historical & Cultural Highlights**:\n   - **Statue of the Virgin Mary**: Near the rocks, marking the legendary spot where nuns were miraculously saved from Tatars.\n   - **Caves & Rock Formations**: The reserve has several small caves (e.g., *Tunnel in Panieńskie Skały*), though most are not accessible to the public.\n   - **Wooden Church**: Nearby, the **Church of Our Lady Queen of Poland** (where the final scene of *The Deluge* (*Potop*) was filmed) adds historical context.\n\n3. **Access & Logistics**:\n   - **Starting Point**: The trailhead is near **Wola Justowska** (western Kraków). Enter from **ul. Panieńska** or **ul. Salwatorska**.\n   - **Public Transport**: Take tram **#3, #5, or #13** to the *\"Salwator\"* stop, then walk ~15 minutes to the reserve entrance.\n   - **Best Time to Visit**: Spring (for wildflowers like wood anemones) or autumn (for golden foliage). Avoid after heavy rain (slippery rocks).\n   - **Combine With**: The nearby **Kościół na Skałce** (Church on the Rock) or **Wawel Hill** for a full day of history and nature.\n\n4. **Conservation Notes**:\n   - Stay on marked paths to protect the fragile ecosystem (e.g., rare snails like *Falniowskia neglectissima*).\n   - No climbing or disturbing the rocks (some are legally protected).\n\n---\n### **Why Follow This Path?**\n- **Efficiency**: Grabowski’s Walkway is the **most scenic and historically significant route** through the gorge, offering geology, folklore, and forest beauty in one short hike.\n- **Personalization**: Ideal for history buffs (Grabowski’s legacy), nature lovers (Jurassic limestone, old-growth forest), and photographers (dramatic cliffs).\n- **Local Tip**: Visit early in the morning for solitude, or at sunset for golden light on the rocks.",
