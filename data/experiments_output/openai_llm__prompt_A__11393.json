It is sometimes called Kostrzewska Hill. It stretches from the Kostrze housing estate in a north-eastern direction towards the Vistula River. At its south-eastern foothills, there is the Pychowice housing estate and Tyniecka Street, while at the north-western side lies Bodzów estate. In the physical and geographical division of Poland, it is located in the Kraków Bridge mesoregion.  \nThe hill rises about 60 m above the surrounding areas. It is situated within the Bielańsko-Tyniecki Landscape Park and is part of the Uroczysko Kostrze. It is built of limestone and covered with forest, predominantly consisting of sycamore, common maple, ash, and Scots pine. The hill serves a recreational function for the city's residents. On its extensive ridge, there is a large meadow, part of which is covered by xerothermic grasslands. This meadow offers a good viewpoint. In good visibility, one can observe the Beskids, Gorce Mountains, Tatras, and the Babia Góra range from there. Marked hiking trails, information boards, and benches have been created for tourists.  \nIn the eastern part of the hill, there used to be a quarry in Bodzów. Motocross riders have taken a liking to its excavation and the surrounding areas of the Solnik hill, resulting in its being worn down. Solnik is also a launch site for paragliders.  \nThe hill and the surrounding streets, including Widłakowa, Tyniecka, and Winnicka, were part of the fortress built by the Austrians known as Fort Krakow. On Solnik, there is an artillery fort belonging to this fortress, the interfield fort 53 \"Bodzów,\" as well as the Caves in Kostrze and the Caves in Bodzów, which served as ammunition depots.  \nHenryk Sienkiewicz placed the story of Zbyszek from Bogdaniec's charge against the Teutonic envoy in his novel Quo Vadis on Solnik.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : peak\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Solnik\nid : 11417\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.8228282 50.0165366)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Kowadza (261 m) – a hill in Tyniec in Kraków.
