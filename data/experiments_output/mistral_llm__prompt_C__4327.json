Construction began in 1692, after Bishop of Kraków Jan Małachowski brought the Visitation order to Kraków in 1681. The construction was completed in 1695 based on plans by Jan Solari. The church was renovated by Tomasz Pryliński between 1875 and 1876. The façade of the church is towerless and topped with a triangular gable. The nave is covered by a barrel vault on arches. \n\nTo this day, the rich Baroque interior has been preserved with paintings depicting scenes from the life of St. Francis de Sales and Jeanne de Chantal (founder of the Visitation), and the treasury also contains many textiles and liturgical vestments from the 18th century. The church houses a miraculous image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, crowned with papal crowns in 1929. Here, the future primate of Poland, August Hlond, received his priestly ordination. Additionally, the garden contains Baroque chapels, including a wooden chapel with a Calvary. On the wall of the convent, there is a sundial with an inscription reading \"Life is a short dream.\"\n\nIn the monastic choir, there is the heart of the founding bishop Jan Małachowski. From 1977 to 2017, the well-known pastor, Fr. Mieczysław Maliński, was the rector of the church. On February 18, 1995, the future President of the Republic of Poland, Andrzej Duda, and Agata Kornhauser-Duda got married in the church.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : place_of_worship\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Krowoderska\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Francis_de_Sales_Church,_16_Krowoderska_street,_Krakow,_Poland.jpg\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Kościół pw.

It is named after Jalu Kurk, a Polish poet and prose writer, representative of the so-called Krakow Avant-Garde. \n\nThe park initially served as the garden of the Montelupich Palace, built in this place in the 15th century. It was common property until the property of the palace was taken over by the Tarnowski family. Stanisław Tarnowski, after remodeling the palace, transferred the palace garden to the city for public use by all residents. In 1948, the Congregation of the Salvatorians purchased the palace along with the park from the Tarnowskis. \n\nAfter World War II, the grounds of the palace and park were taken over by the authorities of the Polish People's Republic. The palace housed the headquarters of Radio Kraków, and the park was fully opened to the city's residents. \n\nAfter 1989, when a property commission for the Catholic Church was established, the congregation applied to the commission for the return of the palace and the adjacent park. The park was returned to the congregation, while the request for the return of the palace was withdrawn by the congregation when the Tarnowski family began efforts to declare the expropriation invalid. \n\nAfter the congregation regained the park, despite numerous protests from local residents, students from the nearby Krakow University of Technology, and councilors from District I, the park was closed. The congregation officially stated that the reason for the park's closure was the lack of funds for repairing the lighting and infrastructure of the park. \n\nIn 2008, the owners of the park applied for development conditions for part of the parkland, wishing to build the European Center for Salvatorian Formation on that site. They also informed that if they received permission for development, the remaining part of the park would be made available to the city's residents. However, the proposal for development was rejected by Jan Janczykowski, the provincial conservator of monuments. \n\nCurrently, an office building is being constructed on a part of the plot that is not protected, which previously served as the entrance to the park. \n\nSince 2017, the authorities of the city of Krakow have been in discussions with the Salvatorians regarding land exchange or the purchase of the park. Ultimately, in 2022, the Krakow municipality purchased the park area for the amount of 11 million PLN. The park was made available to residents on January 1, 2023. The park is open daily from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : park\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Park imienia Jalu Kurka\nid : 3477\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8958066 50.1235526, 19.8957283 50.1236371, 19.8956141 50.1237774, 19.8954784 50.1240811, 19.8954087 50.1241273, 19.8953712 50.1241711, 19.8953551 50.1242187, 19.89539 50.124275, 19.8959546 50.124685, 19.8964093 50.1249883, 19.8964842 50.1250553, 19.8965646 50.1250837, 19.8966584 50.1250858, 19.8967536 50.1250748, 19.8968247 50.1250501, 19.8988446 50.1247998, 19.898931 50.1247695, 19.8989707 50.1247108, 19.8989729 50.1246555, 19.8989718 50.124569, 19.8990823 50.1242494, 19.8992193 50.1239942, 19.8992556 50.1238546, 19.8992497 50.1237641, 19.8991847 50.1237098, 19.899113 50.1236739, 19.8989811 50.1236632, 19.8982268 50.1236766, 19.8980867 50.1236275, 19.8979995 50.1236461, 19.897938 50.1236901, 19.8977665 50.1239124, 19.8973259 50.1238353, 19.8970812 50.1237894, 19.8959081 50.1235715, 19.8958066 50.1235526))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 44 Tonie – a historic armored fort of the Kraków Fortress. It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Fort 44 \"Tonie\"\nid : 3693\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((20.0404114 50.0987452, 20.0405076 50.0987144, 20.0417472 50.0986841, 20.0418206 50.0987123, 20.0419386 50.0986665, 20.0419346 50.0985867, 20.0422783 50.0982016, 20.0424136 50.0981943, 20.0424056 50.0981037, 20.0423085 50.0980261, 20.0413639 50.0980551, 20.0411966 50.0979653, 20.0409156 50.0980472, 20.0399161 50.098093, 20.0398499 50.0981353, 20.0398346 50.0981972, 20.0398587 50.0982339, 20.0399218 50.0982853, 20.0400018 50.0983595, 20.0404114 50.0987452))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 49a Dłubnia – a historic fort of the Kraków Fortress.
