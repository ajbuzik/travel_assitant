The great importance of effective fire defense is evidenced by the fact that the construction of the fire station took precedence in the hierarchy of importance over such investments as: the Słowacki Theatre, Collegium Novum, or the city’s waterworks. The complex of buildings included: barracks for officers and firefighters, a fire department, stables for horse-drawn fire engines and firefighting vehicles, workshops, a hose drying room, a gym, and an alarm telegraph. The unit was equipped with the latest rescue and firefighting equipment at the time: several 4-wheeled, 2-stream fire engines, several manual extension ladders, and a mechanical ladder. The entire complex has survived to this day almost unchanged, with the main building made of red brick adjoining the street and three symmetrically arranged gates. Only one of the outer gates has been remodeled to allow access for modern fire engines, as the building is still used by the fire brigade. The fire station is one of the sites on the Kraków Technical Trail. In the lobby, a fire engine on a horse-drawn carriage is on display.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : fire_station\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Westerplatte\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Jednostka Ratowniczo-Gaśnicza PSP nr 1 w Krakowie\nid : 3461\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.935686 50.0534311, 19.9356133 50.0534661, 19.9356667 50.0535115, 19.9357377 50.0534744, 19.935686 50.0534311))\nhistoric : fortification\nwiki_summary_en : The Noble Tower – a tower on Wawel, dating from the 14th century.

Together with the Sandomierska tower, it forms a unique group of so-called fire towers.\n\nIt was probably erected between 1447 and 1460 during the reign of Casimir Jagiellonian to strengthen the castle's defenses after the spread of new types of artillery. The lower floors are made of stone, while the upper ones are made of brick. Vertical communication was provided by stairs located within the thickness of the wall. Shortly after its construction, a decision was made to raise the tower by covering it with a high steep roof. Around 1517, a new arrow slit was cut into the wall of the ground floor. In 1534, the tower was connected to the southern wing of the royal palace, and the lower floors were remodeled, among other purposes, to accommodate a chamber for the \"young king,\" i.e., Sigismund Augustus. According to Bielski's Chronicle, in 1595, the highest floor above the corbels was lowered \"due to the great weight it had.\" At that time, a finish with panel divides and round windows was created. Its oldest name, Lubranka, comes from the name of the castle's attorney general, Grzegorz from Lubraniec. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was also called Olbramka, Wolbromka, and Skarbowa. Ultimately, the name Senatorska Tower was adopted. In October 1536, a fire destroyed the tower, which was renovated between 1540 and 1543. In 1584, near the tower, Samuel Zborowski was executed.\n\nThe tower has been repeatedly damaged by fires, including in 1656 during the Swedish occupation, and renovated. Around 1858, it was remodeled (like other Wawel towers) by the Austrians, with the removal of the sloping roof and the introduction of a pseudo-Gothic crenellation. Further unfavorable modifications occurred during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1943, when the latrine bay was removed, a window was cut into the ground floor, the vault in the basement was removed, and a fireplace was placed where the historical entrance used to be. Around 1965, the damaged pseudo-Gothic crenellation from the partitioning times was replaced. The repeatedly proposed restoration of the historical shape of the tower with the roof covering was realized only in 2002-2003 according to the design of architect Piotr Stępień in cooperation with Dr. engineer Stanisław Karczmarczyk. The roof was covered with monk-nun tiles, and the latrine bay destroyed by the German occupiers was reconstructed. These works were combined with the conservation of the entire wall of the tower.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Baszta Senatorska;Senatorerturm;Сенаторская башня;Szenátori-torony\nid : 3501\n\nphone : +48 12 4299516\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo-Sa 06:30-17:00; Su 07:00-17:30; Apr-Oct Mo-Sa 06:30-18:00; Apr-Oct Su 07:00-18:30\nwebsite : https://katedra-wawelska.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9350267 50.0547621, 19.9351801 50.0547877, 19.9351852 50.054776, 19.9352863 50.0547883, 19.935287 50.0547842, 19.9353228 50.0547912, 19.9353207 50.054796, 19.9353981 50.0548095, 19.9354382 50.0548137, 19.9354318 50.0548365, 19.9355033 50.0548445, 19.935508 50.0548209, 19.9356347 50.0548346, 19.935633 50.0548414, 19.9356313 50.0548482, 19.9356071 50.0548456, 19.9356039 50.0548584, 19.9357008 50.0548683, 19.9357106 50.0548393, 19.9359061 50.0548663, 19.9359083 50.0548479, 19.9359115 50.054821, 19.9359141 50.0548217, 19.9359204 50.0548158, 19.9359075 50.0548102, 19.9359128 50.0547898, 19.9359218 50.0547906, 19.9359231 50.0547799, 19.935929 50.0547634, 19.9359722 50.0547703, 19.9359682 50.0547857, 19.9360072 50.0547911, 19.9360104 50.0547714, 19.9359976 50.0547702, 19.9360077 50.0547402, 19.9360293 50.0547424, 19.9360324 50.0547325, 19.9360109 50.0547293, 19.9360225 50.0546945, 19.9359589 50.0546852, 19.9359852 50.0546175, 19.935974 50.0546156, 19.9359753 50.0546121, 19.9359837 50.0545885, 19.9358638 50.0545703, 19.9358711 50.0545549, 19.9358382 50.0545504, 19.9358298 50.0545493, 19.9358319 50.0545435, 19.9358228 50.0545421, 19.9358203 50.054548, 19.9356055 50.0545195, 19.9356124 50.0544999, 19.9354891 50.0544821, 19.9354671 50.054545, 19.9354408 50.0545407, 19.9354145 50.0545363, 19.9354442 50.0544728, 19.9353166 50.0544484, 19.9353066 50.0544694, 19.935213 50.0544481, 19.9352133 50.0544473, 19.9351785 50.0544407, 19.9351351 50.0544304, 19.9351279 50.0544194, 19.9351161 50.0544224, 19.9351245 50.0544339, 19.9351163 50.054453, 19.9350942 50.054448, 19.9350819 50.0544632, 19.9350238 50.0544517, 19.9349742 50.054555, 19.9350638 50.0545727, 19.9350576 50.0545886, 19.9350511 50.0546051, 19.9350272 50.0546015, 19.9349591 50.0545914, 19.9349577 50.0545955, 19.9349268 50.0546834, 19.9350349 50.054699, 19.9350396 50.0546904, 19.9350477 50.0546921, 19.9350433 50.0547004, 19.9350204 50.0547442, 19.9349971 50.0547531, 19.935004 50.0547606, 19.9350195 50.0547609, 19.9350267 50.0547621))\nhistoric : yes\nwiki_summary_en : The Wawel Cathedral (Polish: Katedra Wawelska), formally titled the Archcathedral Basilica of Saint Stanislaus and Saint Wenceslaus, (Polish: Bazylika archikatedralna św. Stanisława i św. Wacława) is a Catholic cathedral situated on Wawel Hill in Kraków, Poland. Nearly 1000 years old, it is part of the Wawel Castle Complex and is a national sanctuary which served as the coronation site of Polish monarchs.\nThe current Gothic cathedral is the third edifice on this site; the first was constructed and destroyed in the 11th century and the second one, constructed in the 12th century, was destroyed by a fire in 1305. The construction of the existing church began in the 14th century on the orders of Bishop Nanker. Over time, the building was expanded by successive rulers resulting in its versatile and eclectic architectural composition. There are examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Neogothic elements in the cathedral's façade and interior. The exterior is adorned by side chapels and representative mausoleums, most notable being the golden-domed Sigismund's Chapel.\nIt is the official seat of the Archbishop of Kraków and of the Archdiocese of Kraków. A symbol of Polish statehood and faith, the cathedral hosts important religious events and annual celebrations. Karol Wojtyła, who in 1978 became Pope John Paul II, the day after his ordination to the priesthood offered his first Mass as a priest at the Wawel Crypt on 2 November 1946, and was ordained Kraków's auxiliary bishop in the cathedral on 28 September 1958.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Bazylika archikatedralna pw.

It was built on the site of the former, demolished residence of the Czartoryski family, the previous owners of the farmstead. Constructed by Wincenty Kirchmayer in 1829 or 1831 in the neoclassical style. It was rebuilt around 1905 by Count Kazimierz Osiecimski-Hutten-Czapski, when a tower was added to the western part of the building, which still today bears the owner's coats of arms: Lubicz and Leliwa. The complex also includes a terraced park with an original system of ponds. Before World War II, it was adapted for the needs of an orphanage and a children's hospital. Since 1992, it has been the home of the Monar association (NZOZ MONAR – Rehabilitation and Re-adaptation Center in Krakow).\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : social_facility\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Suchy Jar\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : assisted_living\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%C5%82ac_Kirchmayer%C3%B3w_w_Pleszowie#/media/Plik:Kirchmayer's_Manor,_4_Suchy_Jar_street,_Pleszow,_Nowa_Huta,_Krakow,_Poland.jpg\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pałac Kirchmayerów\nid : 3525\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.8958066 50.1235526, 19.8957283 50.1236371, 19.8956141 50.1237774, 19.8954784 50.1240811, 19.8954087 50.1241273, 19.8953712 50.1241711, 19.8953551 50.1242187, 19.89539 50.124275, 19.8959546 50.124685, 19.8964093 50.1249883, 19.8964842 50.1250553, 19.8965646 50.1250837, 19.8966584 50.1250858, 19.8967536 50.1250748, 19.8968247 50.1250501, 19.8988446 50.1247998, 19.898931 50.1247695, 19.8989707 50.1247108, 19.8989729 50.1246555, 19.8989718 50.124569, 19.8990823 50.1242494, 19.8992193 50.1239942, 19.8992556 50.1238546, 19.8992497 50.1237641, 19.8991847 50.1237098, 19.899113 50.1236739, 19.8989811 50.1236632, 19.8982268 50.1236766, 19.8980867 50.1236275, 19.8979995 50.1236461, 19.897938 50.1236901, 19.8977665 50.1239124, 19.8973259 50.1238353, 19.8970812 50.1237894, 19.8959081 50.1235715, 19.8958066 50.1235526))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : Fort pancerny główny 44 Tonie – a historic armored fort of the Kraków Fortress. It is located at Jurajska Street in Kraków. It was built in 1878 as a so-called provisional work, in the form of an earthen-wooden earthwork. From 1883 to 1885, it was rebuilt into a permanent artillery fort, representative of the then Austrian school of fortification.  \nIt belonged to the IV defensive sector of the fortress. It defended the Olkusz route and the approach from the hillside side towards Giebułów. In cooperation with Fort Marszowiec, it flanked the Prądnik Valley with side fire. After 1897, this last task was taken over by the newly built armored close defense fort 44a Pękowice.  \nFrom 1902 to 1909, it underwent comprehensive modernization. The artillery embankment was completely transformed, now devoid of gun pits and transverse fire positions with emergency shelters, and it was designated for infantry. The neck barrack block and the so-called main shelter block received structural reinforcements (the total thickness of the ceilings and exposed walls averages 2.5 m), making it resistant to hits from 28 cm caliber grenades. In addition, it was equipped with two armored batteries (each for two retractable and rotating towers Senkpanzer M. 2, with rapid-fire guns of 8 cm caliber), a frontal shelter – a base for infantry with an armored dome for observers equipped with Zeiss telescopes, and an armored traditor for four 8 cm guns for minimal firing ports, model M. 98. The armament set was supplemented by 6 old 15 cm guns M. 61 in open battery positions in the center of the fort and casemate guns for defense of the ditches, including modern 6 cm guns M. 99 defending the neck ditch. The resistance standards for the new casemate blocks were similar to those of the old reinforced ones – averaging 2.5 m of ferroconcrete (a layer of concrete on steel I-beams). Changes were also made to the internal communication layout, connecting the newly built frontal shelter on the embankment with the middle emergency shelter of the open battery to the main fort's gallery.  \nThe modernization was very costly, with the total combined cost of construction and modernization amounting to 2,936,406 crowns. This was about two to two-and-a-half times greater than the cost of a typical, unmodernized artillery fort from the 1880s and even six to seven times greater than the cost of a small armored close defense fort from the 1890s. The modernization was not completed – it did not include the caponiers (except for the neck ditch defense casemate). It was likely that they were reinforced temporarily only during the war; this work was also never finished.  \nIn 1914, despite some deficiencies in armament, the fort was one of the most modern and strongest in the fortress, undoubtedly having the greatest resistance to shelling. Its peacetime crew after the modernization was supposed to consist of 428 people, including 11 officers. The standard armament included 6 15 cm (149.1 mm) guns in the open battery, 4 8 cm (76.5 mm) guns in the armored towers, 4 guns of the same caliber (albeit of a different type and with different ammunition) in the traditor, 4 9 cm (87.6 mm) guns in the frontal caponier, 2 6 cm (57 mm) guns for the neck ditch defense, and 8 machine guns (portable). The fort did not participate in battles during World War I, which took place on its further front, beyond the range of its guns.  \nIn the interwar period, it could serve the Polish Army as a residential, barrack facility. According to a record from 1925, it was not in use due to significant dampness. In September 1939, it was temporarily occupied by units of the Fort Group commanded by Colonel Klaczyński and, along with other forts, covered the retreat of the \"Kraków\" Army. According to unconfirmed reports, the Germans lost 2 armored vehicles in its forward area. During the German occupation, it served the occupiers as a storage facility for captured firearms. Under unclear circumstances (there are several differing versions on this) it was damaged due to the explosion and dismantling of parts of the armor – it lost the armored shields of the traditor’s guns and neck caponier, as well as the body and cover of one gun turret. One of the observation towers and both observation domes were blown up and displaced, although they remained on the fort's grounds.  \nAfter World War II, it was used by the military for many years. It housed ammunition and explosives warehouses. The military left it at the beginning of the 1990s, and until 2008 it remained unused, although it was under round-the-clock guard. In the spring of 2008, the foundation for Active Protection of Technical Monuments and Cultural Heritage Janus took it under lease, which is creating a museum called Open Fortress, dedicated to the Kraków Fortress and World War I. The fort is undergoing conservation and renovation work and is periodically opened for visits by organized groups.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Fort 44 \"Tonie\"\nid : 3693\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9471491 49.9940478, 19.9471437 49.9940447, 19.947135 49.9939979, 19.9471406 49.9939921, 19.9473299 49.9939748, 19.9473426 49.9940323, 19.9471491 49.9940478))\nhistoric : fort\nwiki_summary_en : The ammunition shelter \"Swoszowice\" was built between 1913 and 1914 according to a typical design developed before 1913. It has a stone-brick structure with a steel-concrete ceiling covered with metal sheeting. The shelter has one large storage room illuminated by two windows. It is divided by a brick partition wall into an anteroom and the main room. The partition wall has a firing slit covering the entrance. Oil lighting was used, and lamps were placed in wall niches closed with glass doors.

Piłsudski Street 27, in the Piasek area. The \"Sokół\" Gymnastic Society was established on February 23, 1885, at the initiative of students associated with the so-called Academic Reading Room of Jagiellonian University. Its goal was to spiritually and physically revive society by cultivating national traditions, patriotic education, and engaging in sports activities, mainly of a paramilitary nature. The \"Sokół\" Society was formed within the framework of the \"Reading Room.\" It promoted tourism, gymnastics, and various sports: rowing, shooting, fencing, archery, swimming, athletics, and more. In 1889, the city municipality provided the Society with land on what was then Wolska Street, right by the river Rudawa that flowed there at the time. In the same year, a building was constructed, the falconry. It housed the largest gymnasium in Galicia, equipped with the most modern sports facilities. The edifice was designed by Karol Knaus. The official opening of the building took place on November 18, 1889. In 1894, the falconry was expanded. An eastern part designed by Teodor Talowski was added, giving the building neo-Gothic features. In 1921, the Kraków District of the Polish Gymnastic Society \"Sokół\" was based in the building. On July 31, 1947, representatives of the Security Office sealed the \"Sokół\" building, revoking its permit for operation. From 1957, the building was administered by TKKF. \"Sokół\" regained its building in September 1990 and started a major renovation of the building that had been devastated by the previous user, the Cracovia Sports Club. From 2017 to 2020, the first comprehensive renovation and conservation work since the building's inception took place. Almost the entire cost was financed by the National Fund for the Revaluation of Kraków Monuments granted by the Social Committee for the Renewal of Kraków Monuments. On May 15, 1984, the building was entered into the register of monuments. It is also included in the municipal register of monuments.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : sports_centre\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : no\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Hala Sokoła\nid : 11492\n\n",
