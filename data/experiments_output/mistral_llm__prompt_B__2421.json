The monument was erected in 1999 in front of the rolling mill \"Zgniatacz\" of the Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks, the department where the strongest organization of the NSZZ Solidarity was formed at the complex, where in 1988 the strike committee was based, and later a Memory Chamber dedicated to metallurgical \"Solidarity\" was located.\n\nIn 2005, after the privatization of HTS, due to plans to demolish the Zgniatacz, it was moved to Central Square where it was ceremoniously unveiled again. The monument was unveiled by Kazimierz Fugiel, one of the leaders of the first strikes at the steelworks, Władysław Kielian, the chairman of the Steelworkers' Workers' Commission, and Zdzisław Siudak, an employee of the Zgniatacz. The monument was consecrated by the Metropolitan Archbishop of Gdańsk, Tadeusz Gocłowski, and the Metropolitan Archbishop of Kraków, Stanisław Dziwisz.\n\nThe monument takes the form of a steel letter V, mounted on a pedestal (originally made of bricks). This letter is the so-called \"bunny,\" two fingers of the hand arranged in the shape of the letter V symbolizing victory, a gesture by Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War II. Eleven plaques with important dates in the history of Nowa Huta are placed on it, starting from 1960 and the defense of the cross, the date of the election of Karol Wojtyła, and the dates of his visits to Nowa Huta, the date of the establishment of Solidarity, and others. At the base, there is a crowned eagle. Below, on the pedestal, there are four plaques commemorating: the defense of the Nowa Huta cross, the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope, the December events in Gdańsk in 1970, and the establishment of Solidarity in 1980, as well as a fourth commemorating the establishment of NSZZ Solidarity in Nowa Huta. Below the plaques, there is the inscription SOLIDARNOŚĆ written in \"solidaryca.\" At the base of the monument, there is a plaque informing that it is dedicated to \"the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity.\"\n\nThe text on the plaque reads:\nThe monument is dedicated to the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in the post-war period in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity. Its shape refers to the letter V - a symbol of victory. The dates placed on the monument commemorate pivotal events for Nowa Huta's Solidarity, such as: the fight for the cross/1960/ the election of Karol Wojtyła as pope /1978/ and his first pilgrimages to the homeland, including those during which he visited Nowa Huta /1978/1983/ the workers' strikes /1980/1981/1988/ and the reactivation of Solidarity /1989/.\n\nThe monument was built by the Workers' Commission of Steelworkers of the NSZZ Solidarity of the Sendzimir Steelworks at the initiative of Solidarity members from the Rolling Mill Zgniatacz with funds donated by sponsors and collected in a public fundraiser. It was unveiled on November 10, 1999, on the eve of the anniversary of regaining independence. Originally, it stood on the grounds of the Nowa Huta Combined Plant, where in 1980 and 1988, workers' strikes broke out as part of a nationwide protest against the communist authorities and the ideology foreign to the Poles. Glory to the people who, through sacrifice and perseverance, changed the face of Poland and Europe. Be faithful. Go. The poem, of which a fragment is placed on a plaque on the side of the monument, is the message of Mr. Cogito, a character from a series of poems by Zbigniew Herbert.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pomnik Solidarności\nid : 2421\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (20.0258653 50.0798019)\nhistoric : monument\nwiki_summary_en : A monument commemorating the heroes of the Battle of Monte Cassino – a monument located in Krakow, in the XVI Bieńczyce District, at the Niepodległości housing estate on the II Corps of Armed Forces in the West square next to the Kocmyrzowskie Roundabout named after Father Józef Gorzelany.

The small monument was erected in the square where Bogdan Włosik lost his life. On the thirteenth day of each month after 1981, masses for the homeland were held in the nearby Ark of the Lord church, and demonstrations of Solidarity took place, which led to riots and clashes between the residents of Nowa Huta and ZOMO units. During one of the clashes, on October 13, 1982, Bogdan Włosik was shot by an officer of the SB and died. Currently, the square in front of the Ark of the Lord bears his name. The monument, designed by Helena Łyżwa, was unveiled in 1992, on the tenth anniversary of the events. It consists of two blocks of granite, and the space between them is shaped like a cross.

  "answer": "The **Solidarity Monument \"Be Faithful, Go\"** (*Pomnik Solidarności \"Bądź wierny, idź\"*) in **Nowa Huta, Kraków**, commemorates key events related to the **Solidarity (NSZZ Solidarność) movement** and the struggle for workers' rights, faith, and human dignity in communist Poland. The **plaques attached to the monument** highlight the following pivotal events (as described in the context):\n\n### **Key Events Commemorated on the Plaques:**\n1. **Defense of the Nowa Huta Cross (1960)**\n   - A symbolic protest against the communist regime’s attempt to remove a cross from a newly built church in Nowa Huta, a model socialist city. The event marked early resistance to atheist policies.\n\n2. **Election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II (1978)**\n   - The election of the first Polish pope, a native of nearby Wadowice, was a morale boost for Poles under communist rule. His later pilgrimages to Poland (1979, 1983, 1987) inspired the Solidarity movement.\n\n3. **Pope John Paul II’s Pilgrimages to Nowa Huta (1979, 1983)**\n   - His visits to Nowa Huta (a bastion of communist ideology) were acts of defiance, reinforcing faith and solidarity among workers. The 1979 mass in Błonia Meadow drew millions and is considered a catalyst for Solidarity.\n\n4. **Workers’ Strikes (1980, 1981, 1988)**\n   - **1980**: The **Gdańsk Shipyard strikes** (August 1980) led to the founding of **Solidarity**, the first independent trade union in the Soviet Bloc.\n   - **1981**: Strikes during **martial law** (December 1981–1983), when Solidarity was banned.\n   - **1988**: The **Nowa Huta Steelworks strike** (May–June 1988), a pivotal moment in the movement’s revival, demanding the re-legalization of Solidarity.\n\n5. **Reactivation of Solidarity (1989)**\n   - The **Round Table Talks (February–April 1989)** and the **June 1989 elections** (partially free), which led to Solidarity’s victory and the fall of communism in Poland.\n\n6. **December 1970 Protests in Gdańsk**\n   - The **Gdańsk Shipyard protests** (December 1970), brutally suppressed by the communist government, were a precursor to Solidarity. Workers demanded better conditions and political freedoms.\n\n7. **Establishment of NSZZ Solidarity in Nowa Huta (1980)**\n   - The **Sendzimir Steelworks** (where the monument originally stood) was a hotbed of Solidarity activity, with strong worker organization and strike committees.\n\n---\n### **Additional Context from the Monument:**\n- The **letter \"V\"** (for *victory*) symbolizes resistance, inspired by Winston Churchill’s gesture.\n- The **inscription \"SOLIDARNOŚĆ\"** is written in *\"solidaryca\"* (a stylized font used by the movement).\n- A **plaque at the base** honors *\"the memory of the participants of the first solidarity movements and all those unnamed who were the first to stand up in defense of faith, workers' rights, and human dignity.\"*\n- The phrase **\"Be Faithful, Go\"** (*Bądź wierny, idź*) is from a poem by **Zbigniew Herbert**, symbolizing perseverance in the face of oppression.\n\n---\n### **Why This Monument Matters:**\n- **Nowa Huta** was a symbolic battleground between the communist regime and the Catholic Church/workers. The monument celebrates the **grassroots resistance** that contributed to the fall of communism in Poland.\n- The **1988 strike at the steelworks** (where the monument was originally placed) was critical in pressuring the government to negotiate with Solidarity.\n\n---\n### **Visiting Tips:**\n- **Location**: Central Square (*Plac Centralny*), Nowa Huta (easily reachable by tram, e.g., lines **4, 10, 13, 24**).\n- **Nearby POIs**:\n  - **Arka Pana Church** (site of 1980s pro-Solidarity masses).\n  - **Nowa Huta Museum** (exhibits on the district’s socialist history and resistance).\n  - **Steelworks Memory Chamber** (inside the former Sendzimir Steelworks, though access may be limited).\n\nWould you like details on how to combine this visit with other Solidarity-related sites in Kraków (e.g., **St. Mary’s Basilica plaques**, **Wawel Cathedral’s John Paul II connections**, or the **Under the Ram Pub** where dissidents met)?",
