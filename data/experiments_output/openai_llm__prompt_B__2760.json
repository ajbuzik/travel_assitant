The initiator of the monument’s creation was probably Stefan Rejtan, one of the last representatives of the family. It was made between 1856 and 1859 at the Lilpop, Rau, and Loewenstein factory in Warsaw. A faithful copy of the monument can be found on the grave of Stanisław Lilpop at the Warsaw Powązki Cemetery, made after 1866. The monument was given to Krakow as a gift from the Rejtan family in the late 1880s. The official unveiling of the monument in Krakow took place in June 1890; it did not attract much interest from the residents, and the monument itself was repeatedly criticized for its \"cemetery character.\" In fact, the neo-Gothic form of the chapel was a very popular motif in gravestone architecture at that time, and the monument was originally intended to be placed on Rejtan's grave in Lachowicze. The neo-Gothic chapel, made of cast iron, contained a bust of Tadeusz Rejtan signed by the little-known sculptor Teodor Zakrzewski. In February 1946, the monument, damaged by a storm, was dismantled, and the bust of Rejtan was transferred to the collections of the National Museum in Krakow. In the 1990s, the idea of returning the monument to the square, which was once part of the Krakow Planty, emerged. However, the monument was recreated only in 2007. The reconstruction of the monument was undertaken by Czesław Dźwigaj. This was based on meticulously gathered documentation, especially archival photographs, as well as the same monument standing on the Lilpop family tomb at the Warsaw Powązki. The bust itself was made based on the preserved original in the National Museum in Krakow, introducing, as is standard practice in such cases, a so-called \"material error,\" meaning an element that differentiates the replica from the original. In the case of the Krakow monument, Prof. Dźwigaj decided that one of Rejtan's hair strands would be directed differently. The monument stands on a granite base forming two steps, each 30 cm high, measuring 11 meters in height and weighing 6 tons. The cost of recreating the monument was 900,000 zlotys. The installation of the monument took place on May 24, 2007, while the ceremonial unveiling of the monument was conducted on June 9, 2007, during the ongoing celebrations of the 750th anniversary of the founding of the city of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Tadeusz Rejtan\nid : 2384\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : 24/7\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9068228 50.059374, 19.9051515 50.058345, 19.9040932 50.0589615, 19.9035986 50.0592326, 19.9030558 50.059492, 19.9012175 50.0602093, 19.9010762 50.0604061, 19.9018127 50.0614121, 19.902546 50.062412, 19.9231318 50.0592513, 19.9231335 50.0592212, 19.9219675 50.0590566, 19.9192393 50.0586649, 19.9181629 50.0585154, 19.9160288 50.0582089, 19.9139449 50.0579078, 19.909055 50.0572063, 19.907823 50.0570365, 19.9076985 50.0570248, 19.9075061 50.0570248, 19.9077121 50.0570524, 19.9078348 50.0571219, 19.9078745 50.057181, 19.9078169 50.0572328, 19.9079877 50.0573294, 19.9090244 50.0580153, 19.9077734 50.0588218, 19.9077394 50.0587998, 19.9068228 50.059374))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Błonia Park is a vast meadow with an area of 48 hectares directly adjacent to the historic centre of the city of Kraków, Poland.\nThe history of the park began in 1162, when a wealthy nobleman Jaksa z Miechowa – founder of the Polish branch of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre – donated the land between Zwierzyniec and Łobzów to Norbertine Nuns. His intention was to receive a blessing prior to his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. For the next two centuries the meadow belonged to nuns, who in 1366 exchanged it with the city's authorities for a manor at Florianska Street. The meadow was used by peasants from neighboring villages to graze their cattle.\nUntil the 19th century Błonia Park was largely neglected, and often flooded by the Rudawa river in the spring turning it into wetland with small islands, probably contributing to the spread of epidemics. After draining the swamps, Błonia became perfectly suitable to host large gatherings. In 1809, when the city was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw, Błonia was a place of salute of the troops of Napoleon, organized by Prince Jozef Poniatowski and General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski.  \nToday Błonia is a recreation area, frequently hosting large events like concerts and exhibitions. The place is best known for great Masses celebrated by Pope John Paul II in 1979, 1983, 1987, 1997 and 2002. Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated the Mass there during his journey to Poland in May 2006. The opening Mass of the 2016 World Youth Day was held at Błonia Park in July 2016, however the main events, including the Mass celebrated by Pope Francis, were held outside the city.\nBłonia Park is also used to host popular culture events, such as concerts organized by a local radio station or the Iuvenalia student festival. Pop star Celine Dion's Taking Chances World Tour concert on June 28, 2008 performed to nearly 55,000 people  The vast meadow was also used for politicized promotion of the Małopolska region farming industry by PSL in 2011 with a herd of 150 sheep trucked in from hundreds of kilometres away for one month, and the city permit worth 3,200 złoty. The last cattle grazed at Błonia in the 1970s.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : Błonia krakowskie\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : limited\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Błonia;Błonia krakowskie;Lange Wiese;Краковский луг\nid : 3430\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9387655 50.0935991, 19.9387982 50.0936304, 19.9388396 50.0936718, 19.9393858 50.0942121, 19.9394003 50.0942265, 19.939796 50.0946183, 19.9398792 50.0946985, 19.9399606 50.0947802, 19.9399982 50.0948177, 19.9402786 50.0946815, 19.9403077 50.0946788, 19.9403427 50.0946755, 19.9405167 50.0946592, 19.9418397 50.0942213, 19.9440851 50.0934546, 19.9444359 50.0933794, 19.9444766 50.0933723, 19.9445166 50.0933698, 19.9445478 50.0933716, 19.9445366 50.0933124, 19.9444255 50.0929758, 19.9444451 50.0927785, 19.94445 50.0927286, 19.9436043 50.0929382, 19.9432829 50.0930179, 19.9431364 50.0930083, 19.9430851 50.0930049, 19.9428692 50.0929307, 19.9428198 50.0929148, 19.9427197 50.0928883, 19.9425719 50.0928676, 19.9423736 50.0928399, 19.9422212 50.0928317, 19.9420936 50.0927518, 19.9420714 50.0927372, 19.9417284 50.0925121, 19.9414615 50.0924064, 19.9411309 50.0922671, 19.9409954 50.0922188, 19.9408707 50.0921865, 19.9407755 50.0921731, 19.9400066 50.0922184, 19.9401298 50.0923461, 19.9401859 50.0924695, 19.9402139 50.0926669, 19.9401838 50.0926958, 19.9401536 50.0927204, 19.9401186 50.0927481, 19.9400867 50.0927698, 19.9400531 50.0927896, 19.9400189 50.0928083, 19.9399791 50.0928299, 19.9398461 50.0928916, 19.9396273 50.0929924, 19.9393434 50.0931236, 19.9389671 50.0929558, 19.9387234 50.0934174, 19.9387162 50.0934324, 19.9387118 50.0934474, 19.9387085 50.0934627, 19.9387074 50.0934779, 19.9387096 50.0934923, 19.9387153 50.0935071, 19.9387275 50.0935362, 19.9387528 50.0935823, 19.9387587 50.0935902, 19.9387655 50.0935991))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Tadeusz Kościuszko Park – a park in Krakow near the Białoprądnicki Manor (until the end of the 1950s Mirockich), bordered by the streets: Łukasza Górnickiego, Białoprądnicka, Papiernicza, and Józefa Mackiewicza.

It was built on the site of the former, demolished residence of the Czartoryski family, the previous owners of the farmstead. Constructed by Wincenty Kirchmayer in 1829 or 1831 in the neoclassical style. It was rebuilt around 1905 by Count Kazimierz Osiecimski-Hutten-Czapski, when a tower was added to the western part of the building, which still today bears the owner's coats of arms: Lubicz and Leliwa. The complex also includes a terraced park with an original system of ponds. Before World War II, it was adapted for the needs of an orphanage and a children's hospital. Since 1992, it has been the home of the Monar association (NZOZ MONAR – Rehabilitation and Re-adaptation Center in Krakow).\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : social_facility\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Suchy Jar\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : assisted_living\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%C5%82ac_Kirchmayer%C3%B3w_w_Pleszowie#/media/Plik:Kirchmayer's_Manor,_4_Suchy_Jar_street,_Pleszow,_Nowa_Huta,_Krakow,_Poland.jpg\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pałac Kirchmayerów\nid : 3525\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9087754 50.0549646, 19.9088087 50.0550642, 19.9088759 50.0550554, 19.908881 50.0550678, 19.9089439 50.0550587, 19.9089391 50.0550453, 19.9089768 50.0550399, 19.9089443 50.0549395, 19.9087754 50.0549646))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Zwierzyniecki House (formerly Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon) is a branch of the Museum of Krakow located at 41 Queen Hedwig Street in Zwierzyńec, Krakow, at the foot of The Mountain of St. Bronisławy, near the monastery of Ss. Norbertanek, the Church of the Holy Salwator and the Kosciuszko mound. Zwierzyniecki House focuses on local microhistory, researching and documenting the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city. It also organizes short exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat Włodek.\nThis branch of the Museum of Krakow is housed in a typical sub-urban tenement building from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the mason Jan Florczyk. Between July and August 1912, the upstairs apartment accommodated the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, the first Lenin apartment in Krakow exhibit opened in 1970. For ten years, starting in 1980, the building was owned and operated by the Lenin Museum in Kraków, as a subsidiary. Its presentations included temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution, presented alongside the permanent collection (Lenin's apartment). \nIn 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the structure served as a museum warehouse. From 1991 to 1996, some of the halls were used by the Ewa Demarczyk Theatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the museum, the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec, and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts (founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cieślińska-Brzeska), the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established in the location. In cooperation with the Circle of Friends, the branch organized temporary exhibitions, presenting the paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. The art exhibitions continued till 2009, when the branch updated its creative direction, dropping art exhibitions in favour of presentations showcasing the history of Zwierzyńc. The branch changed its name from Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon to Zwierzyniecki House in 2014.\nThe permanent exhibition now features the interior of a Krakow suburb apartment at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch also hosts meetings, lectures, and educational activities for children focusing on the microhistory of Krakow. Seasonal cultural events top the list of activities that harken to pre-city traditions. Key among these events is the Emaus Easter Fiesta, which features a contest for the most beautiful emaus tree. Others include the Corpus Christi meeting with the accompanying Lajkonik parade (also known as Konik Zwierzyniecki) and joint carolling at Yuletide showcasing Christmas trees decorated with toys made by children. \nZwierzyniecki House also serves as an information centre for Zwierzyńec, where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Królowej Jadwigi\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : history\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Dom Zwierzyniecki;Zwierzyniec House;Zwierzyniec Ház\nid : 3613\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9946936 50.0195072, 19.994731 50.0194956, 19.9946995 50.0194544, 19.9947096 50.0194512, 19.9946693 50.0193968, 19.9947123 50.0193848, 19.9947011 50.0193704, 19.9947091 50.0193588, 19.9947595 50.0193456, 19.9947788 50.01935, 19.9947891 50.019364, 19.9948296 50.0193527, 19.9948777 50.019421, 19.9949155 50.0194099, 19.9949473 50.0194551, 19.9949564 50.019468, 19.9949188 50.0194789, 19.9949333 50.0194995, 19.9949849 50.0195118, 19.9950126 50.0195513, 19.9949956 50.0195866, 19.9949273 50.0196062, 19.9948778 50.0195899, 19.9948741 50.0195855, 19.9948063 50.0196074, 19.9947634 50.0195514, 19.9947334 50.0195598, 19.9947193 50.0195622, 19.994704 50.0195612, 19.9946901 50.019557, 19.9946791 50.0195501, 19.9946756 50.0195455, 19.9946723 50.0195413, 19.9946704 50.0195315, 19.9946736 50.0195219, 19.9946816 50.0195134, 19.9946936 50.0195072))\nhistoric : castle\nwiki_summary_en : The Parish of Our Lady of Good Counsel in Kraków – a Roman Catholic parish belonging to the Kraków-Prokocim deanery of the Kraków archdiocese, located in Prokocim at Dygasiński Street.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : attraction\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Górników\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Pałac Jerzmanowskich;Jerzmanowski Palace\nid : 4016\n\nphone : +48 12 658 20 11\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : yes\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : https://www.szpitalzdrowia.pl/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POLYGON ((19.9997597 50.0135884, 20.0001468 50.0134483, 20.0012431 50.0130646, 20.0020039 50.0128086, 20.0027331 50.012545, 20.0027833 50.0125208, 20.002845 50.0124973, 20.0041341 50.011947, 20.0042122 50.0119045, 20.0044646 50.011801, 20.0041517 50.0113549, 20.0038408 50.010973, 20.0032208 50.0102275, 20.0030353 50.010004, 20.0030201 50.0099856, 20.0027637 50.0096709, 20.0023737 50.0095843, 19.999979 50.0104036, 19.9998852 50.0104356, 19.9997242 50.0104904, 19.9991295 50.0106931, 19.9990056 50.0107353, 19.9989613 50.0107504, 19.9989209 50.0107675, 19.9989508 50.0108033, 19.9987425 50.0108785, 19.9987421 50.0110967, 19.998741 50.0116991, 19.9987444 50.011967, 19.9987033 50.0120257, 19.9987211 50.0122213, 19.9987289 50.0123072, 19.9987627 50.0124777, 19.9989328 50.0132393, 19.9989958 50.013515, 19.9990968 50.013615, 19.9992577 50.0137012, 19.9994223 50.0137017, 19.9997597 50.0135884))\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The University Children’s Hospital in Krakow (commonly known as Prokocim) is a clinical hospital located in Krakow, in the XII Bieżanów-Prokocim district at 265 Wielicka Street, in Prokocim.
