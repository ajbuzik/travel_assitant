Centrum C 3, in Aleja Róż, initially as a café. It is referred to as \"iconic.\"  \nThe buildings of the C-31 estate (currently Centrum C) were constructed between 1953 and 1955, and the main designer of building no. 3, where the restaurant is located, was Adam Fołtyn. The café \"Stylowa\" opened on July 22, 1956, and was, alongside the now non-existent restaurant \"Arkadia,\" the most elegant establishment in Nowa Huta. The decor, typical of public interiors from the era of socialist realism, is characterized by a high level of decoration, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, chandeliers, and characteristic columns; the café also had individually designed furniture.  \nIn 1957, the café was under the jurisdiction of the Nowa Huta Gastronomic Enterprises. The guide \"Huta im. Lenina and Nowa Huta\" from that year describes it as a first-category establishment, with a full range of café dishes, exquisite cuisine, and dancing. It was there that the residents of Nowa Huta were taught to enjoy coffee. Guests were welcomed at the door by a porter, and strong alcohol was not served, only Bulgarian wines and brandies. There was a piano inside, which was played in the afternoons. In the 1950s, \"Stylowa\" was frequented by the New Huta elite: engineers, doctors, teachers. Later, the venue gained a reputation as a restaurant for currency speculators.  \nFrom 1973 to 1989, in close proximity to \"Stylowa,\" stood a statue of Vladimir Lenin designed by Marian Konieczny, facing the Central Square. Locals would say that Lenin from Aleja Róż had come out of \"Stylowa\" and was going to \"Arkadia,\" a restaurant located across the square on al. Róż, on os. Centrum B 1 (currently the location of BPH bank). It also happened that currency speculators residing in \"Stylowa\" would jokingly order \"pork chop for Lenin\" and send someone from the staff, for an additional fee, to bring the cutlet to the statue. On the night of April 17-18, 1979, an explosive device was placed under the statue, and as a result of the explosion, only the heel of Lenin's figure was damaged – since that incident, the restaurant has been jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\" The restaurant is also associated with a sports scandal. Early in his football career at Wisła Kraków and the national team, Andrzej Iwan ended up in jail for assaulting one of the waitresses at \"Stylowa\" and was punished with a one-year ban.  \nAfter the political changes, the establishment was taken over by some of the workers. After renovation, it was reopened in October 2003, with guests including Krystyna Zachwatowicz at the ceremony. Currently, \"Stylowa,\" due to its preserved \"People's Poland color,\" is a frequent stop for foreign tourists visiting Nowa Huta, who are interested in the times of communism.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : restaurant\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : polish\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : pedestrian_zone\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : no\nname : Stylowa\nid : 95\n\nphone : +48 12 421 68 42\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : Mo-Su 10:00-18:00\nwebsite : https://galiciajewishmuseum.org/\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : POINT (19.9496775 50.0508571)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : The Galicia Jewish Museum (Polish: Żydowskie Muzeum Galicja) is located in the historic Jewish district of Kazimierz in Kraków, Poland.

Originally, it was located on the southern side of the former Kazimierski Market, of which a small fragment is the present Plac Wolnica. Residential buildings within the market are not an exception; similar ones were located in the Main Market Square in Kraków (or the \"merchant houses\" in the Old Market in Poznań). The Dom Esterki is the only preserved residential house that originally stood at the Kazimierz market (a house formed by the merging of two smaller ones). The oldest part of the cellars of this originally Gothic building dates back to the 14th century, and then the building was remodeled almost every century (the last time in 1876, while its current appearance is mainly due to the renovations carried out at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries). To this day, fragments of Gothic stonework from around 1430 and slightly later (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) have been preserved. In the late 18th century, wooden ceilings were made, and rich polychromy of the walls and ceiling rosettes also date from this period. In the 16th century, the house belonged to the architect and builder working at the court of Polish King Sigismund the Old, and Kazimierz councilor Bartolomeo Bereccy, and later to his daughter Anna. The building is currently topped with a rarely encountered classicist broken roof (the so-called Krakow roof). The name of the building refers to the legend of Esterka, the Jewish bride of King Casimir the Great. Her name is also associated with several other places in Kraków: Ester Street, Esterka Mound, and a small tenement that stood until 1932 at the junction of Szczepański Square and Reformacka Street. Since a thorough renovation took place from 1978 to 1985, Dom Esterki has housed a branch of the nearby Ethnographic Museum. Previously, in the 1950s and 60s, a coffee bar \"Esterka\" operated here.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : no information\ntourism : museum\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : nan\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : nan\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : nan\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Muzeum Etnograficzne (Dom Esterki);Néprajzi Múzeum (Esterka-ház)\nid : 3540\n\nphone : nan\ncemetery : nan\nemergency : nan\nopening_hours : nan\nwebsite : nan\npets_allowed : nan\ngeometry : LINESTRING (19.9099889 50.1142366, 19.9101438 50.1142556, 19.9102534 50.114259)\nhistoric : no information\nwiki_summary_en : Czerwony Most – a historic structure, one of the objects of the Austrian Fortress of Kraków.

A fortified residency on the Vistula River in Kraków, it was established on the orders of King Casimir III the Great and enlarged over the centuries into a number of structures around a Polish Renaissance courtyard. It represents nearly all European architectural styles of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. \nThe castle is part of a fortified architectural complex erected atop a limestone outcrop on the left bank of the Vistula River, at an altitude of 228 metres (748 ft) above sea level. The complex consists of numerous buildings of great historical and national importance, including the Wawel Cathedral where Polish monarchs were crowned and buried. Some of Wawel's oldest stone buildings can be traced back to 970 CE, in addition to the earliest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Poland. The current castle was built in the 14th century, and expanded over the next hundreds of years. In 1978, Wawel was declared the first World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.\nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, Wawel Castle is now one of the country's premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith's work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture.

Piłsudski Street 27, in the Piasek area. The \"Sokół\" Gymnastic Society was established on February 23, 1885, at the initiative of students associated with the so-called Academic Reading Room of Jagiellonian University. Its goal was to spiritually and physically revive society by cultivating national traditions, patriotic education, and engaging in sports activities, mainly of a paramilitary nature. The \"Sokół\" Society was formed within the framework of the \"Reading Room.\" It promoted tourism, gymnastics, and various sports: rowing, shooting, fencing, archery, swimming, athletics, and more. In 1889, the city municipality provided the Society with land on what was then Wolska Street, right by the river Rudawa that flowed there at the time. In the same year, a building was constructed, the falconry. It housed the largest gymnasium in Galicia, equipped with the most modern sports facilities. The edifice was designed by Karol Knaus. The official opening of the building took place on November 18, 1889. In 1894, the falconry was expanded. An eastern part designed by Teodor Talowski was added, giving the building neo-Gothic features. In 1921, the Kraków District of the Polish Gymnastic Society \"Sokół\" was based in the building. On July 31, 1947, representatives of the Security Office sealed the \"Sokół\" building, revoking its permit for operation. From 1957, the building was administered by TKKF. \"Sokół\" regained its building in September 1990 and started a major renovation of the building that had been devastated by the previous user, the Cracovia Sports Club. From 2017 to 2020, the first comprehensive renovation and conservation work since the building's inception took place. Almost the entire cost was financed by the National Fund for the Revaluation of Kraków Monuments granted by the Social Committee for the Renewal of Kraków Monuments. On May 15, 1984, the building was entered into the register of monuments. It is also included in the municipal register of monuments.\npostal_code : nan\ntoilets : nan\nnatural : no information\ndescription : nan\nvisiting_time : nan\nleisure : sports_centre\ntourism : no information\npublic_transport : nan\nbrand : nan\nalt_name : nan\namenity : no information\nreservation : nan\nattraction : nan\nhighchair : nan\nparking : nan\nswimming_pool : nan\ncontact_phone : nan\ncommunity_centre : nan\naddr_street : Marszałka Józefa Piłsudskiego\ncontact_twitter : nan\nsocial_facility : nan\ncontact_facebook : nan\nzoo : nan\nemail : nan\nwheelchair : no\ncuisine : nan\ncontact_website : nan\ninternet_access : nan\nopening_hours_reception : nan\nguest_house : nan\naddr_city : Kraków\ncontact_instagram : nan\nimage : nan\nlocation : nan\noutdoor_seating : nan\nmuseum : nan\ntakeaway : nan\nsmoking : nan\nname : Hala Sokoła\nid : 11492\n\n",
  "answer": "The restaurant \"Stylowa\" has a rich historical context. It is the oldest restaurant in Nowa Huta, operating since 1956. Initially a café, it was known for its elegant decor in the style of socialist realism, featuring sculpted walls, marble floors, and chandeliers. It was a place where residents were introduced to coffee culture and frequented by the intellectual elite of Nowa Huta.\n\nInterestingly, in the 1970s and 80s, a statue of Vladimir Lenin stood nearby. Locals would joke about Lenin emerging from \"Stylowa\" and heading to another restaurant. There's even a story of currency speculators jokingly ordering \"pork chop for Lenin\" and having it delivered to the statue. An incident in 1979, where an explosive device damaged the statue's heel, led to the restaurant being jokingly called \"The Bar Under the Stub.\"\n\n\"Stylowa\" is also associated with a sports scandal involving footballer Andrzej Iwan. After political changes, the restaurant was taken over by workers and reopened in 2003. Today, its preserved \"People's Poland color\" makes it a popular stop for tourists interested in the communist era.",
